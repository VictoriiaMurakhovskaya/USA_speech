{"Name": "Barack Obama", "Speech": "Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Governor.  To all the families, first responders, to the community of Newtown, clergy, guests -- Scripture tells us:  \u201c...do not lose heart.  Though outwardly we are wasting away...inwardly we are being renewed day by day.  For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all.  So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.  For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, an eternal house in heaven, not built by human hands.\u201d We gather here in memory of twenty beautiful children and six remarkable adults.  They lost their lives in a school that could have been any school; in a quiet town full of good and decent people that could be any town in America. Here in Newtown, I come to offer the love and prayers of a nation.  I am very mindful that mere words cannot match the depths of your sorrow, nor can they heal your wounded hearts.  I can only hope it helps for you to know that you\u2019re not alone in your grief; that our world too has been torn apart; that all across this land of ours, we have wept with you, we\u2019ve pulled our children tight.  And you must know that whatever measure of comfort we can provide, we will provide; whatever portion of sadness that we can share with you to ease this heavy load, we will gladly bear it.  Newtown -- you are not alone. As these difficult days have unfolded, you\u2019ve also inspired us with stories of strength and resolve and sacrifice.  We know that when danger arrived in the halls of Sandy Hook Elementary, the school\u2019s staff did not flinch, they did not hesitate.  Dawn Hochsprung and Mary Sherlach, Vicki Soto, Lauren Rousseau, Rachel Davino and Anne Marie Murphy -- they responded as we all hope we might respond in such terrifying circumstances -- with courage and with love, giving their lives to protect the children in their care. We know that there were other teachers who barricaded themselves inside classrooms, and kept steady through it all, and reassured their students by saying \u201cwait for the good guys, they\u2019re coming\u201d; \u201cshow me your smile.\u201d  And we know that good guys came.  The first responders who raced to the scene, helping to guide those in harm\u2019s way to safety, and comfort those in need, holding at bay their own shock and trauma because they had a job to do, and others needed them more. And then there were the scenes of the schoolchildren, helping one another, holding each other, dutifully following instructions in the way that young children sometimes do; one child even trying to encourage a grown-up by saying, \u201cI know karate.  So it\u2019s okay.  I\u2019ll lead the way out.\u201d  (Laughter.) As a community, you\u2019ve inspired us, Newtown.  In the face of indescribable violence, in the face of unconscionable evil, you\u2019ve looked out for each other, and you\u2019ve cared for one another, and you\u2019ve loved one another.  This is how Newtown will be remembered.  And with time, and God\u2019s grace, that love will see you through. But we, as a nation, we are left with some hard questions.  Someone once described the joy and anxiety of parenthood as the equivalent of having your heart outside of your body all the time, walking around.  With their very first cry, this most precious, vital part of ourselves -- our child -- is suddenly exposed to the world, to possible mishap or malice.  And every parent knows there is nothing we will not do to shield our children from harm.  And yet, we also know that with that child\u2019s very first step, and each step after that, they are separating from us; that we won\u2019t -- that we can\u2019t always be there for them.  They\u2019ll suffer sickness and setbacks and broken hearts and disappointments.  And we learn that our most important job is to give them what they need to become self-reliant and capable and resilient, ready to face the world without fear.  And we know we can\u2019t do this by ourselves.  It comes as a shock at a certain point where you realize, no matter how much you love these kids, you can\u2019t do it by yourself.  That this job of keeping our children safe, and teaching them well, is something we can only do together, with the help of friends and neighbors, the help of a community, and the help of a nation.  And in that way, we come to realize that we bear a responsibility for every child because we\u2019re counting on everybody else to help look after ours; that we\u2019re all parents; that they\u2019re all our children.  This is our first task -- caring for our children.  It\u2019s our first job.  If we don\u2019t get that right, we don\u2019t get anything right.  That\u2019s how, as a society, we will be judged. And by that measure, can we truly say, as a nation, that we are meeting our obligations?  Can we honestly say that we\u2019re doing enough to keep our children -- all of them -- safe from harm?  Can we claim, as a nation, that we\u2019re all together there, letting them know that they are loved, and teaching them to love in return?  Can we say that we\u2019re truly doing enough to give all the children of this country the chance they deserve to live out their lives in happiness and with purpose? I\u2019ve been reflecting on this the last few days, and if we\u2019re honest with ourselves, the answer is no.  We\u2019re not doing enough.  And we will have to change. Since I\u2019ve been President, this is the fourth time we have come together to comfort a grieving community torn apart by a mass shooting.  The fourth time we\u2019ve hugged survivors.  The fourth time we\u2019ve consoled the families of victims.  And in between, there have been an endless series of deadly shootings across the country, almost daily reports of victims, many of them children, in small towns and big cities all across America -- victims whose -- much of the time, their only fault was being in the wrong place at the wrong time. We can\u2019t tolerate this anymore.  These tragedies must end.  And to end them, we must change.  We will be told that the causes of such violence are complex, and that is true.  No single law -- no set of laws can eliminate evil from the world, or prevent every senseless act of violence in our society. But that can\u2019t be an excuse for inaction.  Surely, we can do better than this.  If there is even one step we can take to save another child, or another parent, or another town, from the grief that has visited Tucson, and Aurora, and Oak Creek, and Newtown, and communities from Columbine to Blacksburg before that -- then surely we have an obligation to try.  In the coming weeks, I will use whatever power this office holds to engage my fellow citizens -- from law enforcement to mental health professionals to parents and educators -- in an effort aimed at preventing more tragedies like this.  Because what choice do we have?  We can\u2019t accept events like this as routine.  Are we really prepared to say that we\u2019re powerless in the face of such carnage, that the politics are too hard?  Are we prepared to say that such violence visited on our children year after year after year is somehow the price of our freedom? All the world\u2019s religions -- so many of them represented here today -- start with a simple question:  Why are we here?  What gives our life meaning?  What gives our acts purpose?  We know our time on this Earth is fleeting.  We know that we will each have our share of pleasure and pain; that even after we chase after some earthly goal, whether it\u2019s wealth or power or fame, or just simple comfort, we will, in some fashion, fall short of what we had hoped.  We know that no matter how good our intentions, we will all stumble sometimes, in some way.  We will make mistakes, we will experience hardships.  And even when we\u2019re trying to do the right thing, we know that much of our time will be spent groping through the darkness, so often unable to discern God\u2019s heavenly plans.  There\u2019s only one thing we can be sure of, and that is the love that we have -- for our children, for our families, for each other.  The warmth of a small child\u2019s embrace -- that is true.  The memories we have of them, the joy that they bring, the wonder we see through their eyes, that fierce and boundless love we feel for them, a love that takes us out of ourselves, and binds us to something larger -- we know that\u2019s what matters.  We know we\u2019re always doing right when we\u2019re taking care of them, when we\u2019re teaching them well, when we\u2019re showing acts of kindness.  We don\u2019t go wrong when we do that.  That\u2019s what we can be sure of.  And that\u2019s what you, the people of Newtown, have reminded us.  That\u2019s how you\u2019ve inspired us.  You remind us what matters.  And that\u2019s what should drive us forward in everything we do, for as long as God sees fit to keep us on this Earth. \u201cLet the little children come to me,\u201d Jesus said, \u201cand do not hinder them -- for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.\u201d Charlotte.  Daniel.  Olivia.  Josephine.  Ana.  Dylan.  Madeleine.  Catherine.  Chase.  Jesse.  James.  Grace.  Emilie.  Jack.  Noah.  Caroline.  Jessica.  Benjamin.  Avielle.  Allison.  God has called them all home.  For those of us who remain, let us find the strength to carry on, and make our country worthy of their memory. May God bless and keep those we\u2019ve lost in His heavenly place.  May He grace those we still have with His holy comfort.  And may He bless and watch over this community, and the United States of America.  (Applause.)", "Date": "December 16, 2012"}
