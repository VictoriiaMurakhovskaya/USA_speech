{"Name": "Donald Trump", "Speech": "THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, everybody.  Before we begin, I\u2019d like to just say that we have a large team of very talented people in China.  We\u2019ve had a negotiation going on for about two days.  It\u2019s going extremely well.  Who knows what that means, because it only matters if we get it done.  But we\u2019re very much working very closely with China and President Xi, who I respect a lot.  Very good relationship that we have.  And we\u2019re a lot closer than we ever were in this country with having a real trade deal. We\u2019re covering everything \u2014 all of the points that people have been talking about for years that said couldn\u2019t be done, whether it was theft or anything.  Anything.  The unfairness.  We\u2019ve been losing, on average, $375 billion a year with China.  A lot of people think it\u2019s $506 billion.  Some people think it\u2019s much more than that.  We\u2019re going to be leveling the playing field. The tariffs are hurting China very badly.  They don\u2019t want them.  And frankly, if we can make the deal, it\u2019d be my honor to remove them.  But otherwise, we\u2019re having many billions of dollars pouring into our Treasury.  We\u2019ve never had that before with China.  It\u2019s been very much of a one-way street. So, that\u2019s happening.  And the relationship with China is very good, but I think they finally respect our country.  They haven\u2019t respected us for a long time.  Not for a long time. The UK and the U.S., as you probably have been seeing and hearing, we\u2019re agreeing to go forward and preserve our trade agreement.  You know all of the situation with respect to Brexit, and the complexity and the problems.  But we have a very good trading relationship with the UK, and that\u2019s just been strengthened further. So with the UK, we\u2019re continuing our trade, and we are going to actually be increasing it very substantially as time goes by.  We expect that the UK will be very, very substantially increased as it relates to trade with the United States.  The relationship there, also, is very good. We have a lot of great announcements having to do with Syria and our success with the eradication of the caliphate.  And that will be announced over the next 24 hours.  And many other things.  A lot of positive things are going on. We\u2019re working on a summit.  And you know all about the summit.  It will be in Vietnam \u2014 Hanoi.  And we will \u2014 we\u2019ll be meeting in Hanoi.  We\u2019ll be meeting in Hanoi.  I think a lot of you will be going, I suspect.  And I hope we have the same good luck as we had in the first summit.  A lot was done in the first summit.  No more rockets going up.  No more missiles going up.  No more testing of nuclear.  Get back our remains, the remains of our great heroes from the Korean War.  And we got back our hostages. But we hope we\u2019re going to be very much equally as successful.  I\u2019m in no rush for speed.  We just don\u2019t want testing.  The sanctions, as you know, remain.  Everything is remaining.  China has been helping us, and Russia has been helping us.  And South Korea, I think you can say, has been \u2014 we\u2019ve been working very closely with South Korea, with Japan. But China, Russia, on the border, have really been at least partially living up to what they\u2019re supposed to be doing.  And that\u2019s okay \u2014 as per the United Nations. So we will have a meeting on the 27th and 28th of February, and I think that will be a very successful one.  I look forward to seeing Chairman Kim.  We have also established a very good relationship, which has never happened between him or his family and the United States.  They have really taken advantage of the United States.  Billions of dollars has been paid to them.  And we won\u2019t let that happen. But we think that North Korea and Chairman Kim have a tremendous potential as an economic force, economic power.  Their location between South Korea and then Russia and China \u2014 right smack in the middle \u2014 is phenomenal. And we think that they have a great chance for tremendous economic prosperity in the future.  So I look forward to seeing Chairman Kim in Vietnam. Today, I\u2019m announcing several critical actions that my administration has taken to confront a problem that we have right here at home.  We fight wars that are 6,000 miles away; wars that we should have never been in, in many cases.  But we don\u2019t control our own border. So we\u2019re going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border.  And we\u2019re going to do it one way or the other \u2014 we have to do it \u2014 not because it was a campaign promise, which it is.  It was one of many, by the way; not my only one.  We\u2019re rebuilding the military, our economy is thriving like never before. You look at other economies \u2014 they\u2019re doing terribly, and we\u2019re doing phenomenally.  The market is up tremendously today, not that that\u2019s anything, but, you know \u2014 because I\u2019ll go back in and they\u2019ll say, \u201cOh, the market just went down.\u201d  But the market is getting close to the new highs that we created.  We have all the records.  We have every record.  But we\u2019re getting close to that point again where we\u2019ll create new records. So our country is doing very well, economically.  And we\u2019ve done a lot.  But one of the things I said I have to do and I want to do is border security, because we have tremendous amounts of drugs flowing into our country, much of it coming from the southern border.  When you look and when you listen to politicians \u2014 in particular, certain Democrats \u2014 they say it all comes through the port of entry.  It\u2019s wrong.  It\u2019s wrong.  It\u2019s just a lie.  It\u2019s all a lie. They say walls don\u2019t work.  Walls work 100 percent.  Whether it\u2019s El Paso \u2014 I really was smiling, because the other night I was in El Paso \u2014 we had a tremendous crowd, and \u2014 tremendous crowd.  And I asked the people \u2014 many of whom were from El Paso, but they came from all over Texas.  And I asked them.  I said, \u201cLet me ask you, as a crowd: When the wall went up, was it better?\u201d  You were there, some of you.  It was not only better; it was like 100 percent better.  You know what they did. But that\u2019s only one example.  There are so many examples.  In El Paso, they have close to 2,000 murders right on the other side of the wall.  And they had 23 murders.  It\u2019s a lot of murders, but it\u2019s not close to 2,000 murders right on the other side of the wall, in Mexico. So everyone knows that walls work.  And there are better examples than El Paso, frankly.  You just take a look.  Almost everywhere.  Take a look at Israel.  They\u2019re building another wall.  Their wall is 99.9 percent effective, they told me \u2014 99.9 percent.  That\u2019s what it would be with us, too. The only weakness is they go to a wall and then they go around the wall.  They go around the wall and in.  Okay?  That\u2019s what it is.  It\u2019s very simple.  And a big majority of the big drugs \u2014 the big drug loads \u2014 don\u2019t go through ports of entry.  They can\u2019t go through ports of entry.  You can\u2019t take big loads because you have people \u2014 we have some very capable people; the Border Patrol, law enforcement \u2014 looking. You can\u2019t take human traffic \u2014 women and girls \u2014 you can\u2019t take them through ports of entry.  You can\u2019t have them tied up in the backseat of a car or a truck or a van.  They open the door.  They look.  They can\u2019t see three women with tape on their mouth or three women whose hands are tied. They go through areas where you have no wall.  Everybody knows that.  Nancy knows it.  Chuck knows it.  They all know it.  It\u2019s all a big lie.  It\u2019s a big con game. You don\u2019t have to be very smart to know: You put up a barrier, the people come in, and that\u2019s it.  They can\u2019t do anything unless they walk left or right, and they find an area where there\u2019s no barrier, and they come into the United States.  Welcome. We\u2019ve detained more people.  Our border agents are doing such incredible work.  Our military has been incredible.  We put up barbed wire on top of certain old walls that were there.  We fixed the wall and we loaded it up with barbed wire.  It\u2019s very successful. But our military has been fantastic, and I want to thank them.  And it\u2019s very necessary.  We\u2019ve broken up two caravans that are on their way.  They just are breaking.  They\u2019re in the process of breaking up.  We have another one that we haven\u2019t been able to break up yet. We\u2019ve been actually working with Mexico much better than ever before.  I want to thank the President.  I want to thank Mexico.  They have their own problems.  They have the largest number of murders that they\u2019ve ever had in their history \u2014 almost 40,000 murders.  Forty thousand.  And they got to straighten that out, and I think they will. But I just want to thank the President, because he\u2019s been helping us with these monstrous caravans that have been coming up.  We had one that it was up to over 15,000 people.  It\u2019s largely broken up.  Others have gotten through.  And, in Tijuana, you have a lot of people staying there.  If we didn\u2019t have the wall up, and if we didn\u2019t have the wall secured and strengthened, they would have walked right through; they\u2019d be welcomed to the United States. One of the things we\u2019d save tremendous \u2014 just a tremendous amount on would be sending the military.  If we had a wall, we don\u2019t need the military because we\u2019d have a wall. So I\u2019m going to be signing a national emergency.  And it\u2019s been signed many times before.  It\u2019s been signed by other Presidents from 1977 or so.  It gave the Presidents the power. There\u2019s rarely been a problem.  They sign it; nobody cares.  I guess they weren\u2019t very exciting.  But nobody cares.  They sign it for far less important things, in some cases, in many cases.  We\u2019re talking about an invasion of our country with drugs, with human traffickers, with all types of criminals and gangs. We have some of the greatest people I know.  They\u2019ve been with me from the beginning of my campaign \u2014 almost from the first week.  The Angel Moms.  Unfortunately, we have new Angel Moms.  One incredible woman just showed me her daughter who \u2014 we\u2019re talking about killed, in the year of \u201918.  I said, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you before.\u201d  She said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m new.\u201d  I said, \u201cThat\u2019s too bad.\u201d  It\u2019s too bad.  It\u2019s so sad. Stand up, just for a second.  Show how beautiful your girl was.  Thank you. I have such respect for these people.  Angel Moms, Angel Dads, Angel Families.  I have great respect for these people.  These are great people.  These are great people.  They\u2019re fighting for their children that have been killed by people that were illegally in this country. And the press doesn\u2019t cover them; they don\u2019t want to, incredibly.  And they\u2019re not treated the way they should be.  They\u2019re fighting for other people because they don\u2019t want what happened to their children or husband or anybody. We have one young lady whose husband \u2014 please, stand up.  Your husband was just killed in Maryland.  Incredible man.  Just killed.  Beautiful children \u2014 won\u2019t be seeing their father again. These are brave people.  These are people that \u2014 they don\u2019t have to be here.  They don\u2019t have to be doing this.  They\u2019re doing it for other people.  So I just want to thank all of you for being here, okay?  I really do.  I want to thank you.  Incredible people. Last year, 70,000 Americans were killed, at least \u2014 I think the number is ridiculously low \u2014 by drugs, including meth and heroin and cocaine, fentanyl.  And one of the things that I did with President Xi in China, when I met him in Argentina at a summit \u2014 before I even started talking about the trade \u2014 it was a trade meeting.  It went very well, but before I talked about trade, I talked about something more important. I said, \u201cListen, we have tremendous amounts of fentanyl coming into our country.  It kills tens of thousands of people \u2014 I think far more than anybody registers.  And I\u2019d love you to declare it a lethal drug and put it on your criminal list.\u201d  And their criminal list is much tougher than our criminal list.  Their criminal list \u2014 a drug dealer gets a thing called the death penalty.  Our criminal list, a drug dealer gets a thing called, \u201cHow about a fine?\u201d And when I asked President Xi, I said, \u201cDo you have a drug problem?\u201d  \u201cNo, no, no.\u201d  I said, \u201cYou have 1.4 billion people.  What do you mean you have no drug problem?\u201d  \u201cNo, we don\u2019t have a drug problem.\u201d  I said, \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cDeath penalty.  We give death penalty to people that sell drugs.\u201d  End of problem. What do we do?  We set up blue ribbon committees.  Lovely men and women \u2014 they sit around a table, they have lunch, they eat, they dine, and they waste a lot of time.  So if we want to get smart, we can get smart.  You can end the drug problem.  You can end it a lot faster than you think. But President Xi has agreed to put fentanyl on his list of deadly, deadly drugs.  And it\u2019s a criminal penalty.  And the penalty is death.  So that\u2019s, frankly, one of the things I\u2019m most excited about in our trade deal, if you want to know the truth.  I think maybe there\u2019s no more important point. We\u2019re going to make billions of dollars with this trade deal.  It\u2019s going to be great for our country and great for China, I hope.  Their market is down close to 40 percent.  Our market is way up.  We\u2019ve picked up, since my election, trillions of dollars of worth.  Trillions.  Many trillions.  And China has lost trillions of dollars.  But I want it to be good for China and I want it to be good for the United States.  So we\u2019ll see what happens. China is coming here next week, by the way.  They\u2019re coming home, the traders.  And then China is coming here next week.  And then I\u2019ll be meeting with President Xi at some point after that to maybe \u2014 for some remaining deals.  We\u2019ll make them directly, one-on-one, ourselves. So, we\u2019re going to be signing today, and registering, national emergency.  And it\u2019s a great thing to do because we have an invasion of drugs, invasion of gangs, invasion of people, and it\u2019s unacceptable. And by signing the national emergency \u2014 something signed many times by other Presidents \u2014 many, many times.  President Obama \u2014 in fact, we may be using one of the national emergencies that he signed, having to do with cartels.  Criminal cartels.  It\u2019s a very good emergency that he signed.  And we\u2019re going to use parts of it in our dealings on cartels.  So that would be a second national emergency.  But, in that case, it\u2019s already in place. And what we want \u2014 really want to do \u2014 is simple.  It\u2019s not like it\u2019s complicated.  It\u2019s very simple: We want to stop drugs from coming into our country.  We want to stop criminals and gangs from coming into our country.  Nobody has done the job that we\u2019ve ever done.  I mean, nobody has done the job that we\u2019ve done on the border. And in a way, what I did by creating such a great economy \u2014 and if the opposing party got in, this economy would be down the tubes.  You know, I hear a lot of people say, \u201cOh, well.  But maybe the previous administration...\u201d  Let me tell you, the previous administration, it was heading south, and it was going fast.  We would have been down the tubes.  The regulations were strangling our country.  Unnecessary regulations. By creating such a strong economy \u2014 you just look at your televisions or see what\u2019s going on today; it\u2019s through the roof.  What happens is more people want to come, so we have far more people trying to get into our country today than probably we\u2019ve ever had before.  And we\u2019ve done an incredible job in stopping them, but it\u2019s a massive number of people. If we had the wall, it would be very easy.  We would make up for the cost of the wall just in the cost of the fact that I would be able to have fewer people.  We wouldn\u2019t need all of this incredible talent, some of whom are sitting in the first row.  You wouldn\u2019t need all of this incredible talent.  We would get \u2014 we would get thousands of law enforcement people, including Border Patrol.  You put them in different areas, you have them doing different things.  Law enforcement and Border Patrol. And I want to thank law enforcement, and I want to thank Border Patrol, and I want to thank ICE.  ICE is abused by the press and by the Democrats.  And, by the way, we\u2019re going to be taking care of ICE.  You know, we talk about the new bill.  We\u2019re going to be taking care of ICE.  They wanted to get rid of ICE.  And the bill is just the opposite of that.  A lot of good things happened. So, that\u2019s the story.  We want to have a safe country.  I ran on a very simple slogan: \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d  If you\u2019re going to have drugs pouring across the border, if you\u2019re going to have human traffickers pouring across the border in areas where we have no protection, in areas where we don\u2019t have a barrier, then very hard to make America great again. But we\u2019ve done a fantastic job, but we haven\u2019t been given the equipment.  We haven\u2019t been given the walls.  And in the bill, by the way, they didn\u2019t even fight us on most of the stuff.  Ports of entry.  We have so much money, we don\u2019t know what to do with it.  I don\u2019t know what to do with all the money they\u2019re giving us.  It\u2019s crazy. The only place they don\u2019t want to give as much money \u2014 $1,375,000,000.  Sounds like a lot, but it\u2019s not so much, although we\u2019re putting it to much better use than it used to be.  A lot of the past administrations, they had \u2014 it was easy to get, and they didn\u2019t build or they didn\u2019t do what they could have done.  It would have been great.  It would have been great to have done it earlier, but I was a little new to the job, a little new to the profession. And we had a little disappointment for the first year and a half.  People that should have stepped up did not step up.  They didn\u2019t step up, and they should have.  Would have been easy.  Not that easy, but it would have been a lot easier.  But some people didn\u2019t step up.  But we\u2019re stepping up now. So we have a chance of getting close to $8 billion.  Whether it\u2019s $8 billion or $2 billion or $1.5 billion, it\u2019s going to build a lot of wall.  We\u2019re getting it done.  We\u2019re right now in construction with wall in some of the most important areas.  And we have renovated a tremendous amount of wall, making it just as good as new.  That\u2019s where a lot of the money has been spent \u2014 on renovation.  In fact, we were restricted to renovating, which is okay.  But we\u2019re going to run out of areas that we can renovate pretty soon.  So \u2014 and we need new wall. So I want to thank everybody for being here.  I want to thank, in particular, the Angel Moms and Dads for being here.  Thank you very much.  We have great respect for you.  The real country, our real country \u2014 the people that really love our country, they love you.  So I just want you to know that.  I know how hard you fight and I know how hard a fight you\u2019re having. I also want to thank all of the law enforcement for the job you do.  Believe me, our country loves you and they respect you greatly.  And we\u2019re giving you a lot of surplus.  We\u2019re giving you surplus military equipment, which a lot of people didn\u2019t like giving, previous to this administration.  But hundreds of millions of dollars of surplus equipment.  And as we get it, as you know, we send it down.  And you have much better protection.  But I really appreciate you being here. So the order is signed.  And I\u2019ll sign the final papers as soon as I get into the Oval Office.  And we will have a national emergency, and then we will then be sued, and they will sue us in the Ninth Circuit, even though it shouldn\u2019t be there.  And we will possibly get a bad ruling, and then we\u2019ll get another bad ruling.  And then we\u2019ll end up in the Supreme Court, and hopefully we\u2019ll get a fair shake.  And we\u2019ll win in the Supreme Court, just like the ban.  They sued us in the Ninth Circuit, and we lost, and then we lost in the appellate division, and then we went to the Supreme Court, and we won. And it was very interesting, because yesterday they were talking about the ban.  Because we have a ban.  It\u2019s very helpful.  Madam Secretary, is that right?  Without the ban, we\u2019d have a bigger problem.  We have a ban on certain areas, certain countries, depending on what\u2019s going on in the world.  And we won. But somebody said, \u201cPresident Trump lost on the ban.\u201d  Well, he was right; I lost at the lower court.  He \u2014 he didn\u2019t say that we ultimately won at the United States Supreme Court.  They didn\u2019t want to say that.  They didn\u2019t want to go that far.  They were saying how I lost.  The person sitting right up here \u2014 \u201cDonald Trump lost on the ban.\u201d  Yeah, I did.  And then I lost a second time; you should have said that, too.  And then it went to the Supreme Court and I won.  Didn\u2019t want to take it that far.  But we won on the ban and we won on other things, too. The probably easiest one to win is on declaring a national emergency, because we\u2019re declaring it for virtual invasion purposes: drugs, traffickers, and gangs.  And one of the things, just to finish: We have removed thousands of MS-13 gang monsters.  Thousands.  They\u2019re out of this country.  We take them out by the thousands.  And they are monsters. Okay.  Do you have any questions?  Yeah.  John, go ahead. Q    Mr. President \u2014 (inaudible). AIDE:  Yes, we do.  There you go. Q    You were prepared.  Mr. President, a lot of the money \u2014 THE PRESIDENT:  Were you saying I was prepared? Q    With the microphone and prepared for questions. THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, I thought you meant I was prepared.  I couldn\u2019t believe you said that. Q    (Laughs.)  No, no, no.  (Laughter.) THE PRESIDENT:  People don\u2019t like saying that. Q    You were prepared for questions. THE PRESIDENT:  I am prepared.  I\u2019m always prepared. Q    A lot of the money that goes to count toward your $8 billion is money that\u2019s being reprogrammed in the DOD budget.  How can you guarantee to military families and to our men and women of the military that none of the money that would be reprogrammed to a wall will take away from other technology, other renovations, construction that is desperately needed in our military? THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  So, John, we had certain funds that are being used at the discretion of generals, at the discretion of the military.  Some of them haven\u2019t been allocated yet, and some of the generals think that this is more important.  I was speaking to a couple of them.  They think this is far more important than what they were going to use it for.  I said, \u201cWhat were you going to use it for?\u201d  And I won\u2019t go into details, but it didn\u2019t sound too important to me. Plus, if you think, I\u2019ve gotten $700 billion for the military in year one, and then last year, $716 billion.  And we\u2019re rebuilding our military, but we have a lot.  And under the previous administration, our military was depleted \u2014 badly depleted.  And they weren\u2019t spending \u2014 I mean, they had a much less \u2014 they had a much smaller amount of money. So when I got $700 billion, and then $716 billion \u2014 and this year, it\u2019s going to be pretty big too, because there\u2019s few things more important than our military.  You know, I\u2019m a big deficit believer and all of that, but before we really start focusing on certain things, we have to build up our military.  It was very badly depleted.  And we\u2019re buying all new jetfighters, all new missiles, all new defensive equipment.  We have \u2014 we\u2019ll soon have a military like we\u2019ve never had before. But when you think about the kind of numbers you\u2019re talking about \u2014 so you have $700 billion, $716 billion \u2014 when I need $2 billion, $3 billion of out that for a wall \u2014 which is a very important instrument, very important for the military because of the drugs that pour in.  And as you know, we have specific rules and regulations where they have drugs, and what you can do in order to stop drugs.  And that\u2019s part of it, too. We\u2019re taking a lot of money from that realm also.  But when you have that kind of money going into the military, this is a very, very small amount that we\u2019re asking for. Yeah, go ahead.  Go ahead.  ABC.  Not NBC.  I like ABC a little bit more \u2014 not much.  Come on, ABC.  Not much.  Pretty close. Q    Mr. President, what do you say to those, including some of your Republican allies, who say that you are violating the Constitution with this move and setting a bad precedent that will be abused by possibly Democratic Presidents in the future?  Marco Rubio has made this point. THE PRESIDENT:  Well, not too many people.  Yeah.  Not too many people have said that.  But the courts will determine that. Look, I expect to be sued.  I shouldn\u2019t be sued.  Very rarely do you get sued when you do national emergency.  And then other people say, \u201cOh, if you use it for this, now what are we using it for?\u201d  We got to get rid of drugs and gangs and people.  It\u2019s an invasion.  We have an invasion of drugs and criminals coming into our country that we stop, but it\u2019s very hard to stop.  With a wall, it would be very easy. So I think that we will be very successful in court.  I think it\u2019s clear.  And the people that say we create precedent \u2014 well, what do you have?  Fifty-six?  There are a lot of times \u2014 well, that\u2019s creating precedent.  And many of those are far less important than having a border.  If you don\u2019t have a border, you don\u2019t have a country. You know, we fight \u2014 before I got here \u2014 we fight all over the world to create borders for countries, but we don\u2019t create a border for our own country. So I think what will happen is, sadly, we\u2019ll be sued, and sadly, it\u2019ll go through a process.  And, happily, we\u2019ll win \u2014 I think. Go ahead.  Let\u2019s go.  Let\u2019s hear it, NBC.  Come on. Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  I just want to say, in the past, when President Obama tried to use executive action as it related to immigration, you said, \u201cThe whole concept of executive order, it\u2019s not the way the country is supposed to be run.\u201d  You said, \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to go through Congress and make a deal.\u201d  Will you concede that you were unable to make the deal that you had promised in the past, and that the deal you\u2019re ending up with now from Congress is less than what you could have had before a 35-day shutdown? THE PRESIDENT:  No.  Look, I went through Congress.  I made a deal.  I got almost $1.4 billion when I wasn\u2019t supposed to get one dollar \u2014 not one dollar.  \u201cHe\u2019s not going to get one dollar.\u201d  Well, I got $1.4 billion.  But I\u2019m not happy with it.  I also got billions and billions of dollars for other things \u2014 port of entries, lots of different things.  The purchase of drug equipment.  More than we were even requesting. In fact, the primary fight was on the wall.  Everything else, we have so much, as I said, I don\u2019t know what to do with it we have so much money.  But on the wall, they skimped. So I did \u2014 I was successful, in that sense, but I want to do it faster.  I could do the wall over a longer period of time.  I didn\u2019t need to do this.  But I\u2019d rather do it much faster.  And I don\u2019t have to do it for the election.  I\u2019ve already done a lot of wall, for the election \u2014 2020.  And the only reason we\u2019re up here talking about this is because of the election, because they want to try and win an election, which it looks like they\u2019re not going to be able to do.  And this is one of the ways they think they can possibly win, is by obstruction and a lot of other nonsense. And I think that I just want to get it done faster, that\u2019s all. Okay.  Yes, ma\u2019am, go ahead. Q    Thank you, Mr. President. THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you. Q    Roberta Rampton from Reuters.  I wanted to ask about China.  Do you feel that enough progress has been made in the talks to head off the increase in tariffs scheduled for March 1? THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you know, you\u2019re talking to the wrong person, because I happen to like tariffs, okay?  I mean, we\u2019re taking in billions and billions of dollars in tariffs from China.  And our steel industry now, as an example, we tax dumped steel \u2014 much of it comes from China \u2014 at 25 percent.  Our steel industry is so vibrant now again, they\u2019re building plants all over the United States.  It\u2019s a beautiful thing.  And from a defensive standpoint, and from any standpoint, you need steel. You know, you can do without certain industries.  Our country cannot do without steel. So, I love tariffs, but I also love them to negotiate.  And right now, China is paying us billions of dollars a year in tariffs.  And I haven\u2019t even started. Now, here\u2019s the thing: If we make a deal, they won\u2019t have to pay.  You know, it\u2019ll be a whole different story.  They won\u2019t be paying that, but we\u2019ll have a fair deal.  There won\u2019t be intellectual property theft.  There won\u2019t be so many other things that have gone on.  And no other President has done this.  No other \u2014 you know, we didn\u2019t have a deal with China.  You had the WTO, one of the worst trade deals ever made \u2014 probably even worse than NAFTA, if that\u2019s believable, which, you know, hard to believe, because I think NAFTA was just a disaster.  It was a total disaster for our country. And now we made the USMCA, which is going to be a terrific \u2014 a great deal.  And, by the way, the USMCA, from Mexico \u2014 that\u2019s United States, Mexico, Canada \u2014 that\u2019s where the money is coming from, not directly but indirectly, for the wall.  And nobody wants to talk about that.  Because we\u2019re saving billions and billions of dollars a year, if Congress approves that deal. Now, they might now want to approve a deal just because they\u2019ll say \u2014 one of the things I\u2019m thinking of doing \u2014 this has never been done before: No matter how good a deal I make with China, if they sell me Beijing for one dollar, if they give me 50 percent of their land and every ship that they\u2019ve built over the last two years \u2014 which is a lot \u2014 and they give them to me free, the Democrats will say, \u201cWhat a lousy deal; that\u2019s a terrible deal.\u201d Like, ZTE, I got a billion \u2014 more than a billion-dollar penalty in a short period of time.  And the Democrats said, \u201cOh, should\u2019ve gotten more.\u201d  When I made that deal, I said, \u201cThis is incredible.\u201d  I just got \u2014 I got over a billion-dollar penalty, plus they had to change their board of directors.  They had to change their top management.  But they had to pay over a billion dollars.  I said, \u201cWhat a deal.\u201d  It took like a week.  And the Democrats didn\u2019t even know there was a problem with ZTE. I\u2019m the one that find them.  I\u2019m the one that settled it.  Over a billion dollars.  And President Xi called me and he said it would be important to him if they could get a deal.  And we made a deal \u2014 paid \u2014 like, in a short period of time. The Democrats went out and said, \u201cOh, they should\u2019ve done better.\u201d  So what I\u2019m thinking of doing is getting Chuck Schumer, getting Nancy Pelosi, having them bring two or three of their brilliant representatives.  And we\u2019ll all go down together, and what we\u2019ll do is we\u2019ll negotiate.  I\u2019ll put them in the room and let them speak up.  Because any deal I make with China, if it\u2019s the great \u2014 it\u2019s going to be better than any deal that anybody ever dreamt possible, or I\u2019m not going to have a deal.  It\u2019s a very simple. But any deal I make with China, Schumer is going to stand up and say, \u201cOh, it should\u2019ve been better.  It should\u2019ve been better.\u201d  And you know what?  That\u2019s not acceptable to me.  So I\u2019m thinking about doing something very different.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever been \u2014 I just don\u2019t want to be second-guessed.  But that\u2019s not even second-guess; that\u2019s called politics.  Sadly, I\u2019d probably do the same thing to them, okay? But any deal I make toward the end, I\u2019m going to bring Schumer \u2014 at least offer him \u2014 and Pelosi.  I\u2019m going to say, \u201cPlease join me on the deal.\u201d And, by the way, I just see our new Attorney General is sitting in the front row.  Please stand up, Bill.  (Applause.)  Such an easy job he\u2019s got.  He\u2019s got the easiest job in government.  Thank you and congratulations.  That was a great vote yesterday.  Thank you very much. Q    Mr. President \u2014 THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, go ahead.  Go ahead. Q    In your remarks, sir, you said that you were too new to politics, earlier in your administration, when you would\u2019ve preferred that this be done.  Is that an admission of how you might be changing on the job?  And \u2014 THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I\u2019m learning.  I mean, I am learning.  Don\u2019t forget, it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve done this for \u2014 a senator came into my office and said, \u201cSir, I\u2019ve been running for office for 30 years.  I\u2019ve won seven out of seven.  I did lose a couple when I was younger.\u201d  I said, \u201cWell, I\u2019ve won one out of one.  But, you know, I never did politics before.  Now I do politics.\u201d  I will tell you, I\u2019m very disappointed at certain people, a particular one, for not having pushed this faster. Q    Are you referring to Speaker Ryan, sir? THE PRESIDENT:  But I\u2019ve learned \u2014 who? Q    Speaker Ryan. THE PRESIDENT:  Let\u2019s not talk about it. Q    Okay. THE PRESIDENT:  What difference does it make?  But they should have pushed it faster.  They should have pushed it harder.  And they didn\u2019t.  They didn\u2019t. If they would have, it would have been a little bit better.  In the meantime, I\u2019ve built a lot of wall.  I have a lot of money, and I\u2019ve built a lot of wall.  But it would\u2019ve been nice to have gotten done.  And I would like to see major immigration reform, and maybe that\u2019s something we can all work on, Bill, where we all get together and do major immigration reform \u2014 not just for a wall, for a barrier; for port of entry, for other things. We have a real problem.  We have catch-and-release.  You catch a criminal and you have to release them.  We have so many other things.  You have chain migration, where a bad person comes in, brings 22 or 23 or 35 of his family members \u2014 because he has his mother, his grandmother, his sister, his cousin, his uncle \u2014 they\u2019re all in. You know what happened on the West Side Highway.  That young wise guy drove over and killed eight people and horribly injured \u2014 nobody talks about that \u2014 horribly \u2014 like, loss of legs and arms \u2014 going 60 miles an hour, he made a right turn into a park on the West Side Highway, along the Hudson River in New York.  He had many people brought in because he was in the United States.  It\u2019s called chain migration. And then you have the lottery.  It\u2019s a horror show, because when countries put people into the lottery, they\u2019re not putting you in; they\u2019re putting some very bad people in the lottery.  It\u2019s common sense.  If I ran a country, and if I have a lottery system of people going to the United States, I\u2019m not going to put in my stars; I\u2019m going to put in people I don\u2019t want.  The lottery system is a disaster.  I\u2019m stuck with it. Q    Mr. President, could you tell us \u2014 THE PRESIDENT:  It should have \u2014 wait.  It should have never happened.  Okay. Q    Mr. President, could you tell us to what degree some of the outside conservative voices helped to shape your views on this national emergency? THE PRESIDENT:  I would talk about it.  Look, Sean Hannity has been a terrific, terrific supporter of what I do.  Not of me.  If I changed my views, he wouldn\u2019t be with me. Rush Limbaugh \u2014 I think he\u2019s a great guy.  Here\u2019s a guy who can speak for three hours without a phone call.  Try doing that sometime.  For three hours, he speaks.  He\u2019s got one of the biggest audiences in the history of the world.  I mean, this guy is unbelievable.  Try speaking for three hours without taking calls.  Taking calls is easy.  \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll answer this one.  I\u2019ll answer that one.\u201d  He goes for three hours, and he\u2019s got an audience that\u2019s fantastic. Q    Should they be \u2014 THE PRESIDENT:  Wait \u2014 Q    Should they be deciding policy, sir? THE PRESIDENT:   They don\u2019t decide policy.  In fact, if I went opposite \u2014 I mean, they have somebody \u2014 Ann Coulter.  I don\u2019t know her.  I hardly know her.  I haven\u2019t spoken to her in way over a year.  But the press loves saying \u201cAnn Coulter.\u201d  Probably, if I did speak to her, she\u2019d be very nice.  I just don\u2019t have the time to speak to her.  I would speak to her; I have nothing against her. In fact, I like her for one reason: When they asked her, like right at the beginning, who was going to win the election, she said, \u201cDonald Trump.\u201d  And the two people that asked her that question smiled.  They said, \u201cYou\u2019re kidding, aren\u2019t you?\u201d  \u201cNope.  Donald Trump.\u201d So I like her, but she\u2019s off the reservation.  But anybody that knows her understands that.  But I haven\u2019t spoken to her.  I don\u2019t follow her.  I don\u2019t talk to her.  But the press loves to bring up the name \u201cAnn Coulter.\u201d  And you know what?  I think she\u2019s fine.  I think she\u2019s good.  But I just don\u2019t speak to her. Laura has been great.  Laura Ingraham.  Tucker Carlson has been great.  I actually have a couple people on CNN that have been very good.  I have some on MSNBC.  The other day, they did a great report of me.  I said, \u201cWhere the hell did that come from?\u201d  I think it was the only one in over a year. So the crazy thing is, I just had, as you know, Rasmussen \u2014 52 percent in the polls.  It\u2019s my highest poll number.  And people get what we\u2019re doing.  They get it.  They really get it.  And I\u2019m honored by it. Yes.  Jim Acosta. Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  I wonder if you could comment on this disconnect that we seem to have in this country, where you are presenting information about what\u2019s happening at the border \u2014 calling it an \u201cinvasion,\u201d talking about women with duct tape over their mouths, and so on \u2014 and yet there\u2019s a lot of reporting out there, there\u2019s a lot of crime data out there, there\u2019s a lot of Department of Homeland Security data out there that shows border crossings at a near-record low \u2014 THE PRESIDENT:  That\u2019s because of us.  But it\u2019s still \u2014 Q    \u2014 that shows undocumented immigrants committing crime at lower levels \u2014 THE PRESIDENT:  Excuse me.  It\u2019s still massive numbers of crossings. Q    \u2014 that shows undocumented criminals \u2014 or undocumented immigrants committing crime at lower levels than native-born Americans.  What do you say \u2014 THE PRESIDENT:  You don\u2019t really believe that stat, do you?  Do you really believe that stat? Q    What do you \u2014 well, let me ask you this \u2014 THE PRESIDENT:  Take a look at our federal prisons. Q    I believe in facts and statistics and data, but \u2014 THE PRESIDENT:  Okay?  Any more?  Quick, let\u2019s go. Q    Let me just ask you this: What do you say to your critics who say that you are creating a national emergency, that you\u2019re concocting a national emergency here in order to get your wall because you couldn\u2019t get it through other ways? THE PRESIDENT:  I ask the Angel Moms: What do you think?  Do you think I\u2019m creating something? Ask these incredible women, who lost their daughters and their sons.  Okay? PARTICIPANT:  This is real. THE PRESIDENT:  Because your question is a very political question because you have an agenda.  You\u2019re CNN.  You\u2019re fake news.  You have an agenda.  The numbers that you gave are wrong. Take a look at our federal prison population.  See how many of them, percentage-wise, are illegal aliens.  Just see.  Go ahead and see.  It\u2019s a fake question. Yes.  Go ahead. Q    Can I ask a follow-up? Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  Just to follow up on that, unifying crime reporting statistics \u2014 numbers from your own Border Patrol, numbers from this government \u2014 show that the amount of illegal immigrants are down, there is not violence on the border, and that most \u2014 THE PRESIDENT:  There\u2019s not violence on the border? Q    There\u2019s not as much violence as \u2014 THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, really? Q    Let me \u2014 wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait \u2014 THE PRESIDENT:  You had 26 people killed \u2014 Q    Let me finish the question, please.  Let me finish the question, please. THE PRESIDENT:  Two weeks ago, 26 people were killed in a gunfight on the border \u2014 Q    I understand what you\u2019re \u2014 I understand what you\u2019re saying. THE PRESIDENT:  \u2014 a mile away from where I went. Q    I was there.  I understand.  That\u2019s not the question.  The question is \u2014 THE PRESIDENT:  Do we forget about that? Q    No, I\u2019m not forgetting about it.  I\u2019m asking you to clarify where you get your numbers, because most of the DEA crime reporting statistics that we see show that drugs are coming across at the ports of entry, that illegal immigration is down, and the violence is down. THE PRESIDENT:  Okay. Q    So what do you base your facts on? THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, let me \u2014 come on, let\u2019s go.  Sort of \u2014 sort of \u2014 Q    And, secondly \u2014 THE PRESIDENT:  No, no.  You get one.  You get one.  Ready? Q    Well, the second question is \u2014 THE PRESIDENT:  Just sit down.  Wait.  Sit down.  Sit down. Q    Could you please answer it? THE PRESIDENT:  Sit down.  You get one question. I get my numbers from a lot of sources \u2014 like Homeland Security, primarily.  And the numbers that I have from Homeland Security are a disaster.  And you know what else is a disaster?  The numbers that come out of Homeland Security, Kirstjen, for the cost that we spend and the money that we lose because of illegal immigration: Billions and billions of dollars a month.  Billions and billions of dollars.  And it\u2019s unnecessary. Q    So your own government stats are wrong, are you saying? THE PRESIDENT:  No, no.  I use many stats.  I use many stats. Q    Could you share those stats with us? THE PRESIDENT:  Let me tell you, you have stats that are far worse than the ones that I use.  But I use many stats, but I also use Homeland Security. All right, next question. Q    And do you \u2014 wait a minute.  Just a quick follow-up. THE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead.  No.  Go.  Please. Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  I just want to bring you back to China for a second.  The White House put out a statement today talking about the March 1st deadline.  The other day, though, you gave the possibility that maybe this could slide.  Are you eyeing a possible extension \u2014 30 days, maybe 60 days?  What is the status there?  Or is March 1st the deadline? THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  Very good question.  So it\u2019s a very big deal.  I guess you could say it\u2019s like \u2014 must be the biggest deal ever made, if you think.  Trade with China, how big does that get?  Although if you look, the USCMA is right up there.  But it\u2019s very complicated.  There are many, many points that we\u2019re bringing up that nobody ever brought up or thought to bring up, but they\u2019re very important, because we were on the wrong side of every one of them. There is a possibility that I will extend the date.  And if I do that, if I see that we\u2019re close to a deal or the deal is going in the right direction, I would do that at the same tariffs that we\u2019re charging now.  I would not increase the tariffs. Q    Let me also ask you about the debt, sir, because it\u2019s gone from a shade under $20 trillion from when you took office.  Now it\u2019s a shade over $22 trillion and heading in the wrong direction.  What are your plans to reverse it? THE PRESIDENT:  Well, it\u2019s all about growth.  But before I \u2014 Q    (Inaudible.) THE PRESIDENT:  \u2014 really focus on that \u2014 and you have to remember, President Obama put on more debt on this country than every President in the history of our country combined.  So when I took over, we had one man that put on more debt than every other President combined.  Combine them all.  So you can\u2019t be talking about that.  But I talk about it because I consider it very important. But first, I have to straighten out the military.  The military was depleted.  And if we don\u2019t have a strong military \u2014 that hopefully we won\u2019t have to use because it\u2019s strong \u2014 if we don\u2019t have a strong military, you don\u2019t have to worry about debt; you have bigger problems.  So I have to straighten out the military.  That\u2019s why I did the $700- and $716 billion.  But growth will straighten it out. You saw last month, the trade deficit went way down.  Everybody said, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d  Well, what\u2019s happening is growth.  But before I can focus too much on that, a very big expense is military.  And we have no choice but to straighten out our military. Q    Is growth the only answer, sir, or is (inaudible)? THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, ma\u2019am, go ahead. Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  On North Korea \u2014 back on the last summit, you guys came out with a pretty general agreement. THE PRESIDENT:  Yes. Q    I was wondering what you thought has, you know, been accomplished since the last summit.  And then \u2014 THE PRESIDENT:  A lot. Q    \u2014 are we going to be seeing anything concrete \u2014 THE PRESIDENT:  A lot has been accomplished.  Okay. Q    \u2014 on denuclearization. THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  A lot has been accomplished.  We\u2019re dealing with them, we\u2019re talking to them. When I came into office, I met right there, in the Oval Office, with President Obama.  And I sat in those beautiful chairs and we talked.  It was supposed to be 15 minutes.  As you know, it ended up being many times longer than that. And I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the biggest problem?\u201d  He said, \u201cBy far, North Korea.\u201d  And I don\u2019t want to speak for him, but I believe he would have gone to war with North Korea.  I think he was ready to go to war.  In fact, he told me he was so close to starting a big war with North Korea.  And where are we now?  No missiles.  No rockets.  No nuclear testing.  We\u2019ve learned a lot. But much more importantly than all of it \u2014 much more important \u2014 much, much more important that that is we have a great relationship.  I have a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un.  And I\u2019ve done a job.  In fact, I think I can say this: Prime Minister Abe of Japan gave me the most beautiful copy of a letter that he sent to the people who give out a thing called the Nobel Prize.  He said, \u201cI have nominated you...\u201d or \u201cRespectfully, on behalf of Japan, I am asking them to give you the Nobel Peace Prize.\u201d  I said, \u201cThank you.\u201d  Many other people feel that way too.  I\u2019ll probably never get it, but that\u2019s okay. They gave it to Obama.  He didn\u2019t even know what he got it for.  He was there for about 15 seconds and he got the Nobel Prize.  He said, \u201cOh, what did I get it for?\u201d  With me, I probably will never get it. But if you look at Idlib Province in Syria, I stopped the slaughter of perhaps 3 million people.  Nobody talk about that.  They don\u2019t talk about that.  Russia and Iran and Syria were going to go in and perhaps destroy 3 million people in order to get 45,000 terrorists.  And I heard about it from a woman who had her parents and her brothers living there, and she said, \u201cPlease, please.\u201d  And I thought \u2014 I said, \u201cNo, it can\u2019t happen.  What are you talking about?\u201d  \u201cNo, they\u2019re going to get...\u201d  And I come home, and I read a certain paper where the story was there that they were actually forming to go into \u2014 to really \u2014 to really do big destruction.  And I put out a statement that \u201cyou better not do it.\u201d And in all fairness to Russia and Iran and Syria, they didn\u2019t attack.  Or they\u2019re doing it surgically, at least.  Saved a lot of people.  We do a lot of good work.  This administration does a tremendous job, and we don\u2019t get credit for it.  But I think the people understand what we do. So Prime Minister Abe gave me \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s the most beautiful five letter \u2014 five-page letter.  Nobel Prize.  He sent it to them.  You know why?  Because he had rocket ships and he had missiles flying over Japan.  And they had alarms going off; you know that.  Now, all of a sudden, they feel good; they feel safe.  I did that. And it was a very tough dialogue at the beginning.  Fire and fury.  Total annihilation.  \u201cMy button is bigger than yours\u201d and \u201cmy button works.\u201d  Remember that?  You don\u2019t remember that.  And people said, \u201cTrump is crazy.\u201d  And you know what it ended up being?  A very good relationship.  I like him a lot and he likes me a lot.  Nobody else would have done that. The Obama administration couldn\u2019t have done it.  Number one, they probably wouldn\u2019t have done it.  And number two, they didn\u2019t have the capability to do it. So I just want to thank everybody.  I want to wish our Attorney General great luck and speed, and enjoy your life.  (Laughter.)  Bill, good luck.  A tremendous reputation.  I know you\u2019ll do a great job.  Thank you very much.  And thank you, everybody.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.", "Date": "February 15, 2019"}
