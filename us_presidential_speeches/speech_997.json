{"Name": "Donald Trump", "Speech": "Well, thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Wow. (Applause.) Well, thank you very much, everybody. Wow. We\u2019ve all been through a lot together, and we probably deserve that hand for all of us, because it\u2019s been a very unfair situation. I invited some of our very good friends. And we have limited room, but everybody wanted to come. We kept it down to a minimum. And believe it or not, this is a minimum. But a tremendous thing was done over the last number of months, but really, if you go back to it, over the last number of years. We had the witch hunt. It started from the day we came down the elevator, myself and our future First Lady, who\u2019s with us right now. Thank you, Melania. (Applause.) And it never really stopped. We\u2019ve been going through this now for over three years. It was evil. It was corrupt. It was dirty cops. It was leakers and liars. And this should never, ever happen to another President ever. I don\u2019t know that other Presidents would have been able to take it. Some people said, no, they wouldn\u2019t have. But I can tell you, at a minimum, you have to focus on this because it can get away very quickly. No matter who you have with you, it can get away very quickly. It was a disgrace. Had I not fired James Comey \u2014 who was a disaster, by the way \u2014 it\u2019s possible I wouldn\u2019t even be standing here right now. We caught him in the act. Dirty cops. Bad people. If this happened to President Obama, a lot of people would have been in jail for a long time already. Many, many years. I want to start by thanking some of \u2014 and I call them friends, because, you know, you develop friendships and relationships when you\u2019re in battle and war, much more so than, \u201cGee, let\u2019s have a normal situation.\u201d With all that we\u2019ve gone through, we\u2019ve done, I think, more than any President and administration, and really, I say, for the most part, Republican congressmen, congresswomen, and Republican senators. We\u2019ve done more than any administration in the first few years, if you look at all of the things we\u2019ve done. I watched this morning as they tried to take credit for the stock market from \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 from \u2014 think of that. Let me tell you, if we didn\u2019t win, the stock market would have crashed. And the market was going up a lot before the election because it was looking we had a good chance to win, and then it went up tremendously from the time we won the election until the time we took office, which was November 8th to January 20th. And that\u2019s our credit. That\u2019s all our credit. And leading up to that point was our credit because there was hope. And one of the reasons the stock market has gone up so much in the last few days is people think we\u2019re doing so well. They liked the State of the Union speech. (Applause.) It really is \u2014 it\u2019s a true honor to give it. Making the State of the Union speech, I was with some people that have been around; they\u2019ve been all over the world. And one of them, a highly sophisticated person, said, \u201cYou know, no matter where you go in the world, it doesn\u2019t make any difference \u2014 there is nothing like what I witnessed tonight.\u201d The beauty, the majesty of the Chamber. The power of the United States, the power of the people in this room. Really, an amazing \u2014 I don\u2019t think there is anything like that anywhere in the world. You can go to any other country, you can go to any other location, any other place. It\u2019s the beauty of everything. It\u2019s what it represents and how it represents our country. I want to start by introducing some of the people that are here. I know some are going to be left out. But they work so hard. And this is really not a news conference. It\u2019s not a speech. It\u2019s not anything. It\u2019s just we\u2019re sort of \u2014 it\u2019s a celebration, because we have something that just worked out. I mean, it worked out. We went through hell, unfairly. Did nothing wrong. Did nothing wrong. I\u2019ve done things wrong in my life, I will admit. (Laughter.) Not purposely, but I\u2019ve done things wrong. But this is what the end result is. (Applause.) (The President holds up the front cover of The Washington Post newspaper.) We can take that home, Honey. Maybe we\u2019ll frame it. (Laughter.) It\u2019s the only good headline I\u2019ve ever had in the Washington Post, I\u2019ll tell you. (Laughter.) But every paper is the same. Does anybody have those papers? Does anybody have them? Because they\u2019re really like that. So I appreciate that. But some of the people here have been incredible warriors. They\u2019re warriors. And there\u2019s nothing, from a legal standpoint \u2014 this is a political thing. And every time, I\u2019d say, \u201cThis is unfair. Let\u2019s go to court.\u201d They\u2019d say, \u201cSir, you can\u2019t go to court. This is politics.\u201d And we were treated unbelievably unfairly. And you have to understand, we first went through Russia, Russia, Russia. It was all bullshit. (Laughter.) We then went through the Mueller report. And they should have come back one day later. They didn\u2019t. They came back two years later, after lives were ruined, after people went bankrupt, after people lost all their money. People came to Washington to help other people. \u201cBright-eyed and bushy-tailed,\u201d I say. They came \u2014 one or two or three people in particular, but many people. We had a rough campaign. It was nasty. It was one of the nastiest, they say. They say Andrew Jackson was always the nastiest campaign. They actually said we topped it. (Laughter.) It was a nasty \u2014 it was a nasty \u2014 both in the primaries and in the \u2014 in the election. But, you see, we thought, after the election, it would stop. But it didn\u2019t stop; it just started. And tremendous corruption. Tremendous corruption. So we had a campaign. Little did we know we were running against some very, very bad and evil people with fake dossiers, with all of these horrible, dirty cops that took these dossiers and did bad things. They knew all about it. The FISA courts should be ashamed of themselves. It\u2019s a very tough thing. And then we ended up winning on Russia, Russia, Russia. It should have taken the one day, as I said, and it took years. Then Bob Mueller testified. That didn\u2019t work out so well for the other side. (Laughter.) But they should have said, that first week \u2014 because it came out. Is that right, Jim Jordan? They knew in the first two days actually. Devin, is that right? Two days. They knew that we were totally innocent. But they kept it going, Mark. They kept it going forever because they wanted to inflict political pain on somebody that had just won an election that, to \u2014 a lot of people were surprised. I mean, we had polls that said we were going to win. We had Los Angeles Times and a few \u2014 a few papers, actually, said it was \u2014 we were going to win but it was going to be close. And we did win. It was one of the greatest wins of all time. And they said, \u201cOkay, he won.\u201d And, you know, I wrote this down because that was where a thing called the \u201cinsurance policy\u201d \u2014 to me, when I saw the insurance policy \u2014 and that was done long before the election. That was done when they thought that Hillary Clinton was going to win. And, by the way, Hillary Clinton and the DNC paid for millions \u2014 millions of dollars \u2014 the fake dossier. And now Christopher Steele admits that it\u2019s a fake because he got sued by rich people. I should have sued him too. But when you\u2019re President, people don\u2019t like suing. I want to thank my legal team, by the way \u2014 not for that advice, but for other advice. (Applause.) Pat, Jay. Pat. You guys stand up, please. (Applause.) Great job. (Applause.) Right at the beginning, they said, \u201cSir, you have nothing to worry about. All of the facts are on your side.\u201d I said, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. That doesn\u2019t matter. That doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d And that was really true. They made up facts. A corrupt politician named Adam Schiff made up my statement to the Ukrainian president. He brought it out of thin air. Just made it up. They say he\u2019s a screenwriter \u2014 a failed screenwriter. He tried to go into \u2014 unfortunately, he went into politics after that. (Laughter.) Remember he said the statement, which is a mob statement: \u201cDon\u2019t call me. I\u2019ll call you.\u201d I didn\u2019t say that. Fortunately, for all of us here today and for our country, we had transcripts. We had transcribers \u2014 professional transcribers. Then they said, \u201cOh, well, maybe the transcription is not correct.\u201d But Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and his twin brother \u2014 right? \u2014 we had some people that \u2014 really amazing. But we did everything. We said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d \u201cWell, they didn\u2019t add this word or that one.\u201d It didn\u2019t matter. I said, \u201cAdd it. They\u2019re probably wrong, but add it.\u201d So now everyone agrees that they were perfectly accurate. When you read those transcripts, Tim Scott \u2014 I don\u2019t know if Tim is here, but he said, \u201cSir...\u201d He was the first one to call me. \u201cSir, I read the transcript. You did nothing wrong.\u201d And, Mitch, he stayed there, right from the beginning. He never changed. And, Mitch McConnell, I want to tell you: You did a fantastic job. (Applause.) Somebody said, \u201cYou know, Mitch is quiet.\u201d I said, \u201cHe\u2019s not quiet. He\u2019s not quiet.\u201d These are the \u2014 he doesn\u2019t want people to know him. And they said, \u201cIs Mitch smart?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, let\u2019s put it this way: For many, many years, a lot of very smart \u2014 bad, in many cases, sometimes good \u2014 but people have been trying to take his place. And to the best of my knowledge, I\u2019ve never even heard the subject come up, because they\u2019ve been wiped out so fast. (Laughter.) This guy is great, and I appreciate it, Mitch. (Applause.) And he\u2019s also given us 191 now. (Applause.) A hundred and ninety-one federal judges. Two Supreme Court judges, right? It\u2019s up to 191. (Applause.) True. Great guy. Great guy. He\u2019s a tough guy to read. I\u2019m good at reading people. A tough guy to read. I\u2019d call him. My wife would say, \u201cHow did you do with Mitch?\u201d \u201cUhh, I don\u2019t know.\u201d (Laughter.) That\u2019s what makes him good \u2014 when you can read somebody. Fantastic job. And he understood, rightfully, that this was crooked politics. This was crooked politics. How about all these people, they\u2019re running for office. They\u2019re saying the worst things about me, like eight senators on the Democrat side. Most of them got wiped out. You know, they got their 1 percent or less. Most of them got less. They decided to go home. \u201cLet\u2019s go back to California.\u201d Let\u2019s go back to wherever they came from. \u201cLet\u2019s go back to New York.\u201d How about that one? Our New York senator, Gillibrand. \u201cLet\u2019s go back to New York,\u201d after they get nothing. And then they take an oath that they will be fair, that they will be reason- \u2014 and all of the different things. And they had to sign. They\u2019re not fair. But here\u2019s the beauty: So we have four left. They\u2019re saying the most horrendous things about me. It\u2019s okay, it\u2019s politics. And then they\u2019re supposed to vote \u2014 on me. They\u2019re trying to replace me, and then they\u2019re supposed to be voting. So I think it\u2019s \u2014 I mean, I think it\u2019s incredible. But \u2014 so, Mitch, I want to thank you very much. Incredible. And you have some of your folks here, and they\u2019re incredible people \u2014 and they\u2019ve been, right from the beginning. And, again, you\u2019re out of session. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t \u2014 you know, I only told these folks, \u201cLet\u2019s do this today.\u201d We did a prayer breakfast this morning, and I thought that was really good. In fact, that was so good it might wipe this out. But by the end \u2014 by the time we finished this, we\u2019ll wipe that one out \u2014 those statements. (Laughter.) I had \u2014 I had Nancy Pelosi sitting four seats away, and I\u2019m saying things that a lot of people wouldn\u2019t have said \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 but I meant every \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 I meant every word of it. But we have some of the folks that are going to be leaving right after this, and they work hard \u2014 and they did work hard. Bill Cassidy, Senator. Stand up, Bill. What a guy. (Applause.) Great man. When I need to know about health insurance and preexisting conditions and individual mandates, I call Bill or I call Barrasso. We get those two guys; they know more than anybody. A man who just became a senator \u2014 he\u2019s a little bit like me; we have a couple of them. A very successful guy in business, and he said, \u201cWhat the hell, I\u2019ll run for the Senate\u201d \u2014 from Indiana. And he ran. And I saw him on television, destroying his opponent in a debate. I said, \u201cYou know, this guy could win.\u201d And I got behind him. And, Mike Braun, you have done some great job. Thank you very much. (Applause.) Tough. Tough. Thank you. A man who got James Comey to choke, and he was just talking in his regular voice. He is the roughest man. He\u2019s actually an unbelievable \u2014 and I appreciate the letter you sent me today. I just got it. But he\u2019s got this voice that scares people. (Laughter.) You know, people from Iowa can be very tough. We\u2019re doing very well in Iowa. But I\u2019ll tell you, Chuck Grassley \u2014 he\u2019s looking at Comey: \u201cWell, you tell me, what did you say?\u201d (Laughter.) Now, he wasn\u2019t being rough. That was just the way he talked. (Laughter.) And that was when Comey \u2014 I think that was when Comey announced that he was leaking, lying, and everything else, right? He choked because he never heard anybody talk like that. (Laughter.) You know, you should have gone \u2014 I wish you got angry. You could have gotten the whole ballgame. He would have said, \u201cI give up.\u201d (Laughter.) Chuck Grassley is an incredible guy. (Applause.) And a man who \u2014 you know, he was running against a tough, smart campaign and we learned how good she was, right? She was a great campaigner. In fact, by the end of the campaign, she was actually \u2014 I thought she was more for me than you were, Josh. I was worried. (Laughter.) I saw her ad; she was saying the greatest things about me. And you know who I\u2019m talking about. And I went to a great place \u2014 Missouri \u2014 and I said, \u201cWho do you have to beat her?\u201d And they said, \u201cWell, we have four people.\u201d I said, \u201cLet me see them. I\u2019m got to interview...\u201d \u2014 can you imagine? I\u2019m interviewing people for the United States Senate. This is what I do. Where have I gone? But I love it. I love it because we\u2019re getting great people. The first one I met was Josh Hawley. After about 10 minutes, I said to the people, \u201cDon\u2019t show me anybody else. This is the guy.\u201d He was the attorney general. Did a phenomenal job in the state. Highly respected. And \u2014 Claire McCaskill. So, the theory was you couldn\u2019t beat her. Great campaigner. Remember the last campaign, she was going to be taken out. She was always going to be taken out, then she wins and people say, \u201cHow did that happen?\u201d Didn\u2019t happen with him. But she got so friendly toward me. In fact, one of the ads I still have. I\u2019m putting it in the archives as one of the best ads I\u2019ve ever made. (Laughter.) And she tried to convince people that we were best friends. But Josh ended up winning by five or six points. You were unbelievable. You were tough. And you are something. And one of the greatest supporters on the impeachment hoax was Josh Hawley. He was incensed actually; I watched it. He was incensed at what they were doing and what they were saying. And those were the ones \u2014 you know, I had some that said, \u201cOh, I wish you didn\u2019t make the call.\u201d And that\u2019s okay, if they need that. It\u2019s incorrect. It\u2019s totally incorrect. And then you have some that used religion as a crutch. They never used it before. An article written today: \u201cNever heard him use it before.\u201d But today, you know, it\u2019s one of those things. But, you know, it\u2019s a failed presidential candidate, so things can happen when you fail so badly running for President. But, Josh Hawley, I want to thank you. You were right from the beginning. Man, did I make a good choice. (Applause.) Thank you, Josh. Tremendous future. A man who is brilliant and who actually was deceived, to an extent, comes from a great state, Utah, where my poll numbers have gone through the roof. And one of the senators\u2019 poll numbers, and not this one, went down big. You saw that. You saw that, Mike? But Mike Lee is a brilliant guy. He\u2019s difficult. (Laughter.) Whenever I sign bills \u2014 you know, we do sign a lot of legislation that\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s big and it\u2019s powerful, but it\u2019s sort of everybody has to approve it. And I see 99 to 1 \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 99 to 1. I say, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me who\u2019s the one.\u201d (Laughter.) \u201cIs it Mike?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d (Laughter.) And he always has a good reason for it too, by the way. But he is \u2014 he\u2019s incredible. And right at the beginning, he knew we were right, Mike, and I appreciate it very much. You\u2019re just fantastic. And say hello to the people of Utah and tell them, \u201cI\u2019m sorry about Mitt Romney. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d (Laughter and applause.) Okay? We can say that Mike Lee is, by far, the most popular senator from the state. But you\u2019ve done a fantastic job, Mike, in many ways. In many ways. A young woman who I didn\u2019t know at all, but she\u2019s been so supportive \u2014 and I\u2019ve had great support from other people in that state. And she\u2019s been so supportive, and she\u2019s been downright nasty and mean about the unfairness to the President. And Kelly Loeffler, I appreciate very much. Thank you. (Applause.) Great. She saw it very early on, and we have \u2014 I don\u2019t know if we have other senators here, but we got a hell of a lot of congressmen. And I\u2019ll go over them quickly, but they have \u2014 they have also been \u2014 you know, it helped when we won 197 to nothing. That\u2019s got to be a first, Kevin. Right? Is that, like, a first? The Republicans have this image. See, I say Democrats are lousy politicians because they have lousy policy: open borders, sanctuary cities. They have horrible policy. Who the hell can win? Oh, their new policy is: Raise taxes. They want to raise taxes. You know, all my life, I wasn\u2019t in politics, but I\u2019d say, if you\u2019re a politician, you want to say, \u201cWe\u2019re going to lower taxes.\u201d They want to raise taxes. So they have open borders, sanctuary cities. \u201cRaise everybody\u2019s taxes. Get rid of everybody\u2019s healthcare.\u201d A hundred and eighty million people in the United States. And they\u2019re really happy. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to give you a healthcare that\u2019s going to cost more money than the country could make in 30 years if it really does well.\u201d That\u2019s one year. So I\u2019ve always said they\u2019re lousy politicians, but they do two things: They are vicious and mean. Vicious. These people are vicious. Adam Schiff is a vicious, horrible person. Nancy Pelosi is a horrible person. And she wanted to impeach a long time ago. When she said, \u201cI pray for the President. I pray for the...\u201d \u2014 she doesn\u2019t pray. She may pray, but she prays for the opposite. (Laughter.) But I doubt she prays at all. And these are vicious people, but they do two things: They stick together, historically. I\u2019m not talking now. They stick together like glue. That\u2019s how they impeached, because they had whatever the number is \u2014 220 people. So if they don\u2019t lose anybody, they\u2019ll be able to impeach anybody. You could be George Washington. You could have just won the war, and they say, \u201cLet\u2019s get him out of office.\u201d And they stuck together, and they\u2019re vicious as hell. And they\u2019ll probably come back for more, but maybe not because the Republican Party\u2019s poll numbers, Mitch, have now gone up more than any time, I think, since 2004, 2005, and you know what happened then. But in normal times \u2014 decades, you would call it; that was a little unusual time; it was for a very short period \u2014 the Republicans [sic] Party \u2014 Party\u2019s poll numbers and Donald Trump\u2019s poll numbers are the highest I\u2019ve ever had them. So maybe they were. It\u2019s no way to get your poll numbers up. It\u2019s not worth it \u2014 because from my family\u2019s standpoint, it\u2019s been very unfair for my family. It\u2019s been very unfair to the country. Think of it. A phone call. A very good phone call. I know bad phone calls. This is a phone call with many people. I think Mike Pompeo was probably on the call. Where is Mike? Mike Pompeo was on the call. Many people were on the call. I know there were many people. They even have \u201capprenti,\u201d bringing up an old favorite word of mine. \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d They have \u201capprenti.\u201d They have people on these calls. And I know there are many. When I speak to the head of a nation \u2014 and they have many people on.  I mean, also on \u2014 do you think they just \u2014 in the case of Ukraine, he\u2019s a new president, seems like a very nice person, by the way. His whole thing was corruption. He\u2019s going to stop corruption. We even have a treaty \u2014 2001, 1999. It\u2019s a treaty \u2014 signed treaty \u2014 that we will work together to root out corruption in Ukraine. I probably have a legal obligation, Mr. Attorney, to report corruption. But they don\u2019t think it\u2019s corrupt when a son that made no money, that got thrown out of the military, that had no money at all, is working for $3 million up front, $83,000 a month. And that\u2019s only Ukraine. Then goes to China, picks up $1.5 billion. Then goes to Romania, I hear, and many other countries. They think that\u2019s okay? Because if it is \u2014 is Ivanka in the audience? Is Ivanka here? Boy, my kids could make a fortune. (Laughter.) They could make a fortune. It\u2019s corrupt. But it\u2019s not even that; it\u2019s just general corruption. And the other thing, as mentioned in the call and something that I\u2019ve told Mike Pence, our great Vice President \u2014 I would tell him all the time, and I told him when he went on the trip, because he was over there. He never mentioned anything about this when you had your meeting. It\u2019s a terrible thing. But I told Mike. I said, \u201cMike, we\u2019re giving them money, and, you know, you\u2019re always torn about that because we have our country to build, we have our cities to build and our roads to fix. But we\u2019re giving them money. Tell me, why isn\u2019t Germany paying money? Why isn\u2019t France? Why isn\u2019t United Kingdom paying money? Why aren\u2019t they paying money? Why are we paying them money?\u201d Is that a correct statement, Mike? I say, \u201cFind out what the hell is going on.\u201d And I told that to all of my people, OMB. I said \u2014 I asked that question: \u201cHow much is Germany paying? Why isn\u2019t Germany paying?\u201d Why is the United States always the sucker? Because we\u2019re a bunch of suckers. But that\u2019s turning around fast. But it makes it harder when stuff like this happens, because you want to focus, and you want to focus perfectly. Think what we could have done if the same energy was put into infrastructure, prescription drug prices. Think of what we could have done. And I\u2019m now talking both sides. Think of what we could have done if we had the same genius \u2014 because it\u2019s genius. I will say, it\u2019s genius on the other side \u2014 maybe even more so because they took nothing and brought me to a final vote of impeachment. That\u2019s a very ugly word to me. It\u2019s a very dark word. Very ugly. They took nothing. They took a phone call that was a totally appropriate call. I call it a \u201cperfect call\u201d because it was. And they brought me to the final stages of impeachment. But now we have that gorgeous word \u2014 I never thought a word would sound so good. It\u2019s called \u201ctotal acquittal.\u201d (Applause.) Total acquittal. So \u2014 so I want to, if I could, real fast, just introduce a few of the people. I have to start with \u2014 I have to start with Kevin. Man, did you do a job. Lucky you\u2019re there. Lucky you\u2019re there because it wouldn\u2019t have worked out. If you don\u2019t have the right people \u2014 I\u2019ll tell you, Kevin McCarthy has done an incredible job. (Applause.) Really. Stand up. And he loves this job, and he loves this country. I\u2019ll tell you what: Mitch and Kevin, they love what they do. Now, Mitch wouldn\u2019t even tell you he liked it. (Laughter.) I\u2019d say, \u201cMitch, do you like it?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d (Laughter.) He\u2019s the greatest poker player, right? Kevin will say, \u201cI love it.\u201d Right? And I will say that you\u2019re going to be Speaker of the House because of this impeachment hoax. (Applause.) I really believe it. I really believe it. And I\u2019m going to work hard on it. I\u2019m going to try and get out to those Trump \u2014 those Trump areas that we won by a lot. And, you know, in \u201918, we didn\u2019t win. We just won two seats in North Carolina \u2014 two wonderful seats in North Carolina that were not supposed to be won. But I went and I made speeches, and we had rallies, and we did a great job and we won. We took two seats. Nobody writes about that. If we lost them, it would have been the biggest story of the year. But we\u2019re going to go, we\u2019re going to do a job, and we\u2019re going to win a lot of seats. We\u2019re going to win a lot of seats. People are very angry that Nancy Pelosi and all of these guys \u2014 I mean, Nadler \u2014 I know him much of my life; he\u2019s fought me in New York for 25 years. I always beat him. And I had to beat him another time. And I\u2019ll probably have to beat him again. Because if they find that I happen to walk across the street, and maybe go against the light or something, \u201cLet\u2019s impeach him.\u201d (Laughter.) So we\u2019ll probably have to do it again because these people have gone stone-cold crazy. But I\u2019ve beaten them all my life, and I\u2019ll beat them again if I have to. (Applause.) But what they\u2019re doing is very unfair. Very unfair. So Kevin McCarthy has been great. So, a few names, right? And there\u2019ll be a few you forget. If you want, you can raise and I\u2019ll say, \u201cGreat. Love to have you. Wonderful.\u201d (Laughter.) But we\u2019re going to do the best we can. And I have my Cabinet, but my Cabinet is different \u2014 I appoint them. Okay? I didn\u2019t see all of them helping so much. (Laughter.) You know, they were running their various bureaucracies, right? (Laughter.) No, my Cabinet is great, and they\u2019re all here. But today is the day to celebrate these great warriors, right? These are great warriors. They really fought hard for us. And \u2014 So I\u2019ll start: Kelly Armstrong, North Dakota. Kelly, thank you. Great job. (Applause.) Great job. Jim Banks of Indiana. Jim, thank you. Great job. (Applause.) Andy Biggs. Where is Andy? Boy, oh, boy, Andy. He got \u2014 (applause) \u2014 there\u2019s a guy. He\u2019s tough. I hear we\u2019re doing well in Arizona, huh? It\u2019s going good, yeah? I think so. I think I saw a poll that was very good for me. I think we have to make sure Martha is going to do \u2014 I think Martha is going to do good. But we have some states that are going to be not easy, but Arizona has been great. And we\u2019re stopping illegal aliens from coming in. We\u2019re putting up walls. New Mexico, too, a state that\u2019s never been in play for Republicans, is totally in play. Right? Nevada is really looking good. We\u2019re doing well. We\u2019re doing well. We\u2019re going to have a great \u2014 there\u2019s more spirit. I will say this: There\u2019s more spirit now for the Republican Party, by far, than the Democrats. You know, Mike Pence just got back from a place \u2014 a beautiful place that Chuck Grassley knows well: Iowa. And he was talking about these fiasco \u2014 the Democrats, they can\u2019t count some simple votes, and yet they want to take over your healthcare system. Think of that. (Laughter.) No, think of it. But we also had an election out there, and we got 98 percent of the vote. We have two people running, you know, and I guess they consider them non-people, but they are running. I mean, one was a governor. One was a congressman. They\u2019re running. We got 98 percent of the vote. And everybody from the media was saying, \u201cWho are those crowds over there?\u201d You know, they expect it to be one of these competitive \u2014 where everybody is running because they want to win, they want to win. And it was Trump. Right, Mark Meadows? It was Trump. This was a Trump crowd. And a lot of \u2014 actually, a lot of my guys went there. They went to Iowa. And a lot of friends went there, and we had tremendous \u2014 they say the spirit \u2014 the spirit for the Republican Party right now is stronger, I think, than it\u2019s ever been in the history of our country. I think it\u2019s stronger than it\u2019s ever been. (Applause.) And that includes Honest Abe Lincoln. You know, a lot of people forget Abe Lincoln. I wish he were here. I\u2019d give him one hell of an introduction. Right? (Laughter.) But he was \u2014 he was a Republican. Abe Lincoln. Honest Abe. Bradley Byrne, Alabama. What a great place. (Applause.) Thank you, Bradley. A man who has been an unbelievable friend of mine and spokesman, and somebody that \u2014 that I really like. And I know, Kelly, you\u2019re going to end up liking him a lot. Something is going to happen that\u2019s going to be very good. I don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t figured it out yet. But Doug Collins \u2014 where is he? Where is Doug? (Applause.) You have been so great. Thank you very much, Doug. Thank you very much. Thank you. Really amazing job. A young man who is \u2014 born with a great gene, because I know his father and how great a politician he was. But he\u2019s from Florida. Sometimes controversial, but actually, he\u2019s not controversial. He\u2019s solid as a rock and he\u2019s a friend of mine. Matt Gaetz. Matt? (Applause.) Thank you, Matt. Thank you. Great job. All right, this guy. So he\u2019s the NCAA \u2014 meaning, a couple of years ago, when he was in college \u2014 wrestling champion. NCAA. That\u2019s the big deal. That means, in all of college, you\u2019re the champ, you\u2019re the best. His record was ridiculous. Nobody would \u2014 nobody could beat him. And I see it. You know, every time, I see it. When I first got to know him \u2014 Jim Jordan \u2014 when I first got to know Jim, I said, \u201cHuh, he never wears a jacket. What the hell is going on?\u201d (Laughter.) He\u2019s obviously very proud of his body. (Laughter and applause.) And they say where he works out \u2014 you know, where the congressmen, senators, they work out \u2014 they say, when Jim works out \u2014 even though he\u2019s not as young as he was, but he works out \u2014 the machine starts burning. You know, it\u2019s just a different form of a workout than us. Right, Sonny? And \u2014 there he is. Look at that guy. But one day I\u2019m looking, and he looks tough. And I\u2019m looking, and I\u2019m looking at those ears. And I say, \u201cThose ears have something going on there.\u201d I said, \u201cDid you ever wrestle?\u201d \u201cYeah, I did.\u201d But he doesn\u2019t talk. But I checked. This guy was a world \u2014 this guy was a champion, top, top wrestler. And when I had the top \u2014 I had all of the teams. And, by the way, your Super Bowl champions are coming, I think next week or soon. Very soon. And every one of them want to be here. (Applause.) And the coach loves us. The coach is great. Andy Reid. And every one of them want to be here. We have \u2014 people love it. But we had all of the NCAA championship teams here. They had the golf, the basketball. They had every team here. And one of the teams was wrestling. The wrestling team. Was that Penn State? And Penn State won the title. They have a great team. And I walked up with Jim, and it\u2019s like I didn\u2019t exist. (Laughter.) Those wrestlers, they grabbed him. They love Jim Jordan, and we love you too because you are some warrior. (Applause.) True. True. A woman who became a star \u2014 we have a couple of women that became stars. You two. And I always liked the name of her \u2014 you know, I liked the name, \u201cLesko.\u201d I liked it. That\u2019s how I picked it. I liked the name. I saw that face. I saw that everything. They gave me cards. She had like seven opponents, right? And you have no idea how much the public appreciates how smart, how sharp you are. This I can\u2019t tell. I can\u2019t tell. They just said, \u201cYou know, she\u2019s really good. She\u2019s really talented.\u201d And I said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d We worked with her. She won her race. Tough race. It\u2019s no longer tough. Because what she does out there is incredible. Arizona loves her. But you were so incredible, representing \u2014 I don\u2019t say \u201cme\u201d \u2014 representing our country and getting it out of this impeachment hoax. What you did was incredible. So, Debbie, please stand up. Debbie Lesko. (Applause.) A man who I \u2014 I became very friendly with \u2014 I don\u2019t know why. Do you ever have where \u2014 I\u2019ll ask the media: If certain people call, you take their calls. Other people call \u2014 if they don\u2019t have information, they won\u2019t take anybody\u2019s call. But other people call, and you don\u2019t. This is a guy \u2014 he just \u2014 he\u2019s just a very special guy. His wife I actually like better than him, to be honest. (Laughter.) Because he doesn\u2019t know that I know that he didn\u2019t actually support me right from the beginning, but she did. (Laughter.) And on my worst day \u2014 right? \u2014 on my worst day, my worst \u2014 I won\u2019t tell you why it was my worst, but it was not one of those good days \u2014 she got on a bus, got many other buses and women all over North Carolina, and they toured North Carolina. Well, Mark was back sort of semi-supporting another candidate, which he ended up leaving very quickly. I don\u2019t think you had a choice, because of your wife, but thank her. And Mark Meadows, he\u2019s an extraordinary guy. I mean, the only problem is, I guess, he\u2019s announcing \u2014 he\u2019d only win by 40 points, but he\u2019s announcing that he\u2019ll be not running this time. Do you have somebody good to run? Somebody going to win your district by at least 20 points, please? Okay? But he\u2019s a tremendously talented man, not just as a politician. As a human being, he\u2019s incredible. And during these horrible times \u2014 I mean, the way he worked and Jim and all of you guys \u2014 the way they worked so \u2014 it was like their life was at stake. So many. Ron DeSantis is another one. He worked so hard. Then he called me. He said, \u201cSir, I\u2019d like to run for governor.\u201d I said, \u201cGovernor? I don\u2019t want you to run. I like you staying.\u201d \u201cNo, I want to run for governor.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, if you have to.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like your support.\u201d I said, \u201cHow can I support you? You\u2019re at three.\u201d He was at three. He had no money. Somebody was at 38 and they had $22 million cash, right? I said, \u201cLook, if it\u2019s important, I\u2019ll do it,\u201d because they \u2014 he\u2019s been another great warrior. And he\u2019s \u2014 by the way, he ran. I endorsed him. His numbers went through the roof. The man who we beat, who was expected to win easily, called me after the race. He said, \u201cYou endorsed him, and it was like a nuclear bomb went off. There was nothing I could do.\u201d He never even spent his money. He saved it. But Ron DeSantis is another one, and now he\u2019s the governor of Florida. And, by the way, he\u2019s a great governor. He\u2019s a very popular governor. His numbers are in the 70s. And he\u2019s done a great job. But, Mark, I want to thank you very much. Fantastic job. Thank you very much. Mark Meadows. (Applause.) And Mike Johnson of Louisiana. Where\u2019s Mike? Central casting. What a job. You can represent me anytime. (Applause.) You can represent me anytime. Thank you. What a job you\u2019ve done. Thank you, Mike. And a man nobody has ever heard of, except the other side. He\u2019s the other side\u2019s worst nightmare. This guy goes down into dungeons and basements; he\u2019ll find a document, no matter what. He\u2019s the most legitimate human being. He\u2019s the hardest worker. He\u2019s unbelievable.  He took tremendous abuse. I mean, abuse. The \u2014 the media and, you know, the other side, and the bad ones, the leakers, the liars, the dirty cops \u2014 they wanted to destroy him. They tried. They got close, but he wouldn\u2019t let it happen. And, honestly, in a certain way, he was the first one. Wouldn\u2019t you say, Jim and Mark and everybody? This was the first guy. He came out of nowhere. He\u2019s saying, \u201cThese people are corrupt.\u201d He\u2019s still saying it. And he was unbelievable. Devin Nunes. He was unbelievable. Unbelievable. (Applause.) That\u2019s so true, Devin. He\u2019d come in and say \u2014 I didn\u2019t even know hi;, I just heard there were like \u2014 there was this congressman who kept going into a basement \u2014 into files. (Laughter.) He knew something was wrong. You felt it, right? And now we know a lot more than we knew then, right? You never thought it was as bad as it is. And hopefully we\u2019re going to take care of things, because we can never, ever allow this to happen again. (Applause.) Scott Perry of Pennsylvania. Scott, thank you. (Applause.) Thank you, Scott. Really great. And you\u2019re doing very well over there, by the way. Just saw your numbers.\r\nA man who is a \u2014 I mean, central casting. If I\u2019m going to pick Perry Mason, I\u2019m going to do a remake of Perry Mason \u2014 other than Bill Barr, I\u2019d pick this guy. But I have to say, I\u2019ll pick Barr. I pick Barr first, right? (Laughter.) John Ratcliffe, right? But I have to tell you, if we\u2019re doing a remake of Perry Mason, the man I get \u2014 there\u2019s nobody in Hollywood like this \u2014 John Ratcliffe, right? (Applause.) Stand up, John. So \u2014 such a great lawyer. Incredible guy. Incredible talent. But just a great lawyer and we appreciate it. He gets on that screen, and everyone says, \u201cI agree.\u201d The other side folds up so fast. We\u2019ll probably be using a lot of you in the next year. But you have been fantastic, John. We appreciate it. Thank you very much. A man who\u2019s braver than me and braver than all of us in this room. He got \u2014 he got whacked. He got whacked. My Steve, right? I went to the hospital with our great First Lady that night. Right, honey? And we saw a man that was not going to make it. He was not going to make it. He was \u2014 the doctor \u2014 and I told him his wife \u2014 I said, \u201cShe loves you.\u201d \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d Because she was devastated. A lot of wives wouldn\u2019t give a damn. (Laughter.) A lot of \u2014 a lot of wives \u2014 a lot of wives would have said, \u201cOh, yeah.\u201d I said, \u201cHow\u2019s he doing?\u201d \u201cOh...\u201d She couldn\u2019t even talk. She was inconsolable. Most wives would say, \u201cNot good. Listen, I\u2019m going home now.\u201d (Laughter.) But the doctor came in \u2014 the wife is like \u2014 she was a total mess. She was really devastated. And he really \u2014 it looked like he had a 20, 25 percent chance. I think you set a record for blood loss. And, Steve Scalise, I \u2014 actually, honestly, I think you\u2019re better looking now. You\u2019re more handsome now. (Laughter.) You \u2014 you weren\u2019t that good looking. You look good now. (Laughter.) He looks better now. Can you believe it? I don\u2019t know what the hell that is. (Applause.) It\u2019s true. Better now. (Applause.) What a guy. And he was practicing \u2014 he was practicing for the baseball game against, I guess, the Democrats, right? And this whack-job started shooting. Hurt Roger \u2014 I don\u2019t know if Roger is here. But hurt a number of people \u2014 hit them. But really hit Steve. He \u2014 Steve was at second base. He was the second baseman. And he went down and it was terrible. I mean, I saw the whole thing and it was terrible. Fortunately, you had two brave policemen with you. Because of your high position in Congress, you had two policemen and they were amazing \u2014 the man and a woman. And they came and they didn\u2019t have rifles. They were against a, supposedly, pretty good sharpshooter with rifles \u2014 good equipment. And all they had was a gun. And they started coming in from the outfield, shooting. And they\u2019re so far away that a handgun is not preferred. This guy has the rifle and he\u2019s hitting people. And he was going to move up and there was no out. I mean, if he would have been able to move up, there was no way to get out. The entrance was a single entranceway on the other side, where he was. So everyone went into the dugout \u2014 ran into the dugout, but Steve was really hit badly in the stomach, and \u2014 with a bullet that rips you apart. It was supposed to do that. It rips \u2014 it rips you apart. And these two people came charging forward. Boom. Boom. Boom. And one of them \u2014 you know who \u2014 one of them \u2014 him? \u2014 got the shooter. Hit him. And then got him. Killed him from the long distance. It was amazing. If you didn\u2019t have those two people \u2014 you can imagine, right? You could imagine what would happen. So Melania and I went to the hospital that night. And he was in such bad shape, and he\u2019s been working ever since, so hard. But six months ago, they had a baseball game at the Nationals Park. And I\u2019m watching and it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s on television. And it\u2019s just, you know, a game. People \u2014 you want to win it, right? And Steve\u2019s at second base. The poor guy can\u2019t even walk. Do you remember Bobby Richardson for the New York Yankees? He was known for range, Louie. Range. He had the greatest range. If a ball is hit to shortstop \u2014 Bobby Richardson is the second player, the second baseman \u2014 Bobby Richardson would field the ball. If it\u2019s hit to first base, he\u2019ll throw it to the first baseman. He had unbelievable range. This was not Steve Scalise. (Laughter.) Steve had no range. (Laughter.) One foot and he has to fall down, right? Because, you know, he was trying to get better. I don\u2019t know who the hell put you on the field. (Laughter.) And this is a true story. So the game starts and the first pitch \u2014 Steve is standing at second base and the guy is really in bad shape. And I said, \u201cThis is terrible.\u201d A shot \u2014 groundball shot is hit to second and Steve. I say \u2014 I didn\u2019t have time to think too much, but I said, \u201cThis is not good. That ball is going toward him.\u201d And this guy stopped that ball, caught the call. He\u2019s now laying down. He throws the ball to first base. He gets him out. I said, \u201cIt\u2019s the most incredible thing.\u201d I\u2019ve never seen \u2014 athletically \u2014 (applause) \u2014 I\u2019ve never seen anything like it, right? And he gets him out and they then took him out of the game, which was a very wise thing because you could never do that again in a million years. (Laughter.) But you weren\u2019t going to let that ball go through. I don\u2019t care if it was hit by the greatest of all time, right? That ball was not going through you, because you are a warrior. Steve is \u2014 he is fantastic. You are fantastic. You and Liz and Kevin. What a great \u2014 what a group. I mean, what a group. I got lucky. I got lucky because you need the right people. If I had the wrong people there, he \u2014 maybe a different story. Maybe we\u2019d be celebrating something else. But I really want to thank you, Steve Scalise. And, Elise, you \u2014 I just read this story; she\u2019s the most incredible \u2014 what\u2019s going on with you, Elise. So I even said \u2014 you know, I was up campaigning for her, helping her. But I thought, \u201cShe looks good. She looks like good talent.\u201d But did I not realize, when she opens that mouth, you were killing them, Elise. (Laughter.) You were killing them. (Applause.) Elise \u2014 and there\u2019s a big story in the New York Post \u2014 I love the New York Post because they treat me well. There aren\u2019t too many of you that do. But today, you\u2019re treating me well. I even had a great headline \u2014 New York Times, Washington Post. I had all of these great headlines. Maybe we should just end it right there. (Laughter.) But you had the greatest story, yesterday in the Post, that people from all over the country are contributing to her campaign. They were so enthralled with the way you handled yourself, what you said, the way you said it. And I\u2019ll always be your friend. I think it was \u2014 it\u2019s really an amazing story. What a great future you have. What a great future. Thank you. (Applause.) The First Lady agrees, by the way. The First Lady agrees. And Michael Turner, you can represent me anytime. Where\u2019s Michael? Where is he? (Applause.) Or you can represent me. How good were you? There\u2019s another \u2014 there\u2019s another Perry Mason type, I think. Right? What do you think, John? But, Michael, you were fantastic and we appreciate it. Brad Wenstrup. Where\u2019s Brad? Brad. (Applause.) Great, great job. This is a big day for lawyers. You notice only the lawyers stayed? All the lawyers stayed behind. Lee Zeldin. How good are you? How good are you? (Applause.) Man. And, Louie, your name is not down. They didn\u2019t give me your name. Do you know \u2014 if I didn\u2019t announce Louie \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 whoever the hell made this list, I got to get rid of because I \u2014 if I wouldn\u2019t have announced Louie, it might have been the end of the presidency. (Laughter.) Louie, you have been so great. So tough and so smart. I got it just \u2014 (laughs) \u2014 I got it. But Louie has been amazing. He\u2019s a tough guy. He\u2019s a smart guy. He\u2019s streetwise like crazy. We love Texas, and we\u2019re with you all the way, Louie. We\u2019re with you all the way. Thank you very much. (Applause.) So that\u2019s the story. We have a great group of warriors, and there are others left, and, I guess, probably, I\u2019m sure I didn\u2019t mention a few, and I apologize if that\u2019s the case. How\u2019s CPAC doing? Good? Huh? My man, stand up please, will you? He\u2019s the one who said, \u201cYou should run.\u201d (Applause.) Right? Matt said \u2014 it\u2019s like five years ago, six years ago. And I made a speech, and then they do some kind of a straw poll: \u201cWho made the best speech?\u201d And he said, \u201cI made the best speech.\u201d With all this professional \u2014 I hate to say this: With all these professional politicians, they voted, by far, the best speech was Trump. He calls me, he says, \u201cYou should run for politics.\u201d I say, \u201cWhat do I know about politics?\u201d But you know what? We learned quickly, and our country has never done better than it\u2019s doing right now. (Applause.) So it\u2019s been good. (Applause.) But thank you, Matt. Great. Say hello. So that\u2019s the story. We\u2019ve been treated very unfairly. Fortunately, we have great men and women that came to our defense. If we didn\u2019t, this would have been a horrific incident for our country. When you have Lisa and Peter, the lovers, the FBI lovers: \u201cI want to believe the path you threw out for\u201d Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. That\u2019s the office. \u201cThere\u2019s no way he gets elected\u201d \u2014 meaning me. \u201cThere\u2019s no way he gets elected.\u201d This is Peter, to Lisa. He\u2019s probably trying to impress her, for obvious reasons. (Laughter.) \u201cThere\u2019s no way he gets elected. But I\u2019m afraid we can\u2019t take the risk.\u201d Now, think of this. In other words, if I get elected, they can\u2019t \u2014 \u201cthey\u201d; two low-lifes \u2014 they can\u2019t take the risk. They can\u2019t take the risk. Think of it. And that\u2019s where it came up, the greatest word of all: \u201cinsurance policy.\u201d So he says, \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid we can\u2019t take the risk. She may lose.\u201d It\u2019s like an insurance policy. In the unlikely event you die before you\u2019re 40 \u2014 in other words, if I won, they were going to do exactly what they did to us. They were going to try and overthrow the government of the United States \u2014 a duly elected president. And if I didn\u2019t fire James Comey, we would have never found this stuff. Because when I fired that sleazebag, all hell broke out. They were ratting on each other. They were running for the hills. Let\u2019s see what happens. Let\u2019s see what happens. It\u2019s in the hands of some very talented people. We\u2019re going to have to see what happens. But I can tell you, in my opinion, these are the crookedest, most dishonest, dirtiest people I\u2019ve ever seen. They said \u2014 this is Strzok: \u201cGod, Hillary should win 100 million to one.\u201d This is about me. This is an agent from the FBI. Look how they let her off. Thirty-three thousand emails deleted. Nothing happens to her. Nothing happens. It\u2019s unbelievable. But think of that \u2014 \u201cGod, Hillary should win\u201d \u2014 when these guys are investigating Hillary. Then they go to work for Mueller \u2014 the two of them \u2014 and when Muller found out that everybody knew that they were 100 percent this way, he let them go. But they deleted all of their emails and text messages. So when we got the phone, they were all deleted. Could you imagine the treasure trove? They illegally deleted. So they left. They left Bob Mueller. He had the look, but he didn\u2019t have a lot of other things. Always had the look. Mr. G-Man. And I love the FBI and the FBI loves me \u2014 99 percent. It was the top scum. And the FBI people don\u2019t like the top scum. So think of that: 100 million to one. And he\u2019s investigating me. And then, \u201cGod, Trump is a loathsome human being, isn\u2019t he?\u201d These are the people looking at me. I\u2019m really not a bad person. And Page said, \u201cYes, he\u2019s awful.\u201d How would you like to have that? This is just \u2014 this is the good stuff. There\u2019s stuff a hundred times worse than that. These are all dirty people. And now, I just heard that they\u2019re suing the United States of America because they were interfered with. We\u2019re not going to let it happen. Just not going to let it happen. We cannot let this happen to our country. We can\u2019t. (Applause.) So, I\u2019m going to leave now. And I don\u2019t know if any of you have anything to say. You could say it. But this is sort of a day of celebration, because we went through hell. And I\u2019m sure that Pelosi and Cryin\u2019 Chuck \u2014 I\u2019ve known this guy all the \u2014 the only time I ever saw him cry was when it was appropriate. Known him for a long time. Cryin\u2019 Chuck. But I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll try and cook up other things. They\u2019ll go through the state of New York. They\u2019ll go through other places. They\u2019ll do whatever they can. Because instead of wanting to heal our country and fix our country, all they want to do \u2014 in my opinion, it\u2019s almost like they want to destroy our country. We can\u2019t let it happen. Jim Jordan, did you want to say something? Go ahead. Huh? Mark? REPRESENTATIVE MEADOWS: No, I just \u2014 I wanted to just say that this reflection today, it is a small reflection of the kind of support you have all across the country. We\u2019ve got your back. (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) This was a highly partisan situation. Pelosi said \u2014 I copied it down exactly. Before the impeachment \u2014 she wanted to impeach from day one, by the way. Don\u2019t let it fool you. You know, she said, \u201cNo, the impeachment is a very serious thing.\u201d I said, \u201cShe wants to impeach. Watch.\u201d Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there\u2019s something so compelling and so overwhelming and bipartisan \u2014 bipartisan. It was 197 to nothing. And other than one failed presidential candidate \u2014 and I call that \u201chalf a vote\u201d because he actually voted for us on the other one. But we had one failed presidential candidate. That\u2019s the only half a vote we lost. So, we had almost 53 to nothing. We had 197 to nothing. And the only one that voted against was a guy that can\u2019t stand the fact that he ran one of the worst campaigns in the history of the presidency. But she said, \u201cThere\u2019s something so compelling \u2014 it has to be so compelling and so overwhelming and bipartisan. I don\u2019t think we should go down that path, because it divides the country\u201d \u2014 she was right about that \u2014 \u201cand it\u2019s just not worth it.\u201d That was Nancy Pelosi a year ago. Right? And I think it\u2019s a shame. I think it\u2019s a shame. But as I said, if we can put this genius to work on roads and highways and bridges and all of the things we can do \u2014 prescription drugs. You know, we had \u2014 Secretary Azar is here and I want to thank him for this, but we had \u2014 first time in 51 years, where drug prices actually came down last year. First time in 51 years. But what we can do, working with both parties in Congress, is \u2014 would be unbelievable. It would be unbelievable \u2014 all we can do. And I know Chuck Grassley is working very hard on it and Mitch is working very hard on it. But what we can do is \u2014 is incredible. What we can do, just generally. We\u2019ve done so much without it. We\u2019ve rebuilt our military. We\u2019ve cut regulations at a level that nobody thought possible. We\u2019ll always protect our Second Amendment; we all know that. But I just want to tell you that it\u2019s an honor to be with you all. I want to apologize to my family for having them have to go through a phony, rotten deal by some very evil and sick people. And Ivanka is here, and my \u2014 my sons and my whole family, and that includes Barron. (Applause.) That includes Barron, who is up there as a young boy. Stand up, honey. (Applause.) Ivanka, thank you, honey. Come. Come. (Applause.) (The President hugs Ivanka Trump.) Come here, baby. (Applause.) (The President hugs the First Lady.) So I just want to thank my family for sticking through it. This was not part of the deal. I was going to run for President, and if I won, I was going do a great job. I didn\u2019t know that I was going to run, and then when I got in, I was going to have to run again and again and again. Every week, I had to run again. That wasn\u2019t the deal, but they stuck with me. And I\u2019m so glad I did it because we are making progress and doing things for our great people that everybody said couldn\u2019t be done. Our country is thriving. Our country is just respected again. And it\u2019s an honor to be with the people in this room. Thank you very much, everybody. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.)", "Date": "February 06, 2020"}
