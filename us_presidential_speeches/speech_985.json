{"Name": "Donald Trump", "Speech": "THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Lee. Thank you, Lee. Thank you. AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! THE PRESIDENT: And thank you also to Commander Harman. We\u2019re grateful for your service, for your leadership, and this incredible organization. That\u2019s what it is\u2014it\u2019s incredible. (Applause.) I\u2019m honored to be here today in Kansas City, Missouri, to pay tribute to the men and women who make freedom possible. Kansas City. And what a special place. What a special group of people. The Veterans of Foreign Wars, you people should be very proud of yourselves. I want to personally thank each and every one of you who has served our country in uniform, defended our nation in battle, and protected our great American flag. Thank you. (Applause.) I also want to recognize a great Kansas City legend, who I met today at the plane\u2014somebody that I\u2019ve been a fan of for a long time; a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame\u2014George Brett of the Kansas City Royals. (Applause.) Where\u2019s George? He\u2019s around here someplace. I said, \u201cGeorge, how many years?\u201d \u201cTwenty.\u201d \u201cWhat was your batting average?\u201d \u201c.305.\u201d I said, that\u2019s pretty good\u2014.305 for 20 years. Special guy. I want to thank a true patriot, your executive director, Bob Wallace, along with your outstanding National Auxiliary President, Dee Guillory. Thank you, Dee. (Applause.) And congratulations to VFW\u2019s incoming leadership, BJ Lawrence and Sandy Kreebull. (Applause.) Where are they? Great. Great. Congratulations. We\u2019re also joined by our brand new VA Secretary, Robert Wilkie\u2014he\u2019s going to be fantastic\u2014who was just confirmed by the Senate last night with an overwhelming vote. The only ones, actually, that voted against him were all of the people, super-lefts, that are running against me in two and a half years. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: Booo \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Every one of them. If you want to know who\u2019s running, just take a look at Wilkie\u2019s score, because every single one of them\u2014there will be probably quite a few more\u2014but in the Senate, that was it. But what a great vote. And he\u2019s going to do a fantastic job. There\u2019s been nothing more important to me. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. I also want to thank our Acting VA Secretary, Peter O\u2019Rourke, for doing such a fantastic job in the meantime, holding down the fort until Wilkie got approved. And Peter is going to be joining the whole team, and they are doing numbers, and they are doing a job, with Choice and with all of the other things that we\u2019ve gotten approved. They\u2019re doing some job for our vets. It was a very important commitment that I made to you during the campaign, and we\u2019re fulfilling that commitment. Several terrific members of Congress are here today as well. Great friends of mine; they\u2019ve helped me so much. We\u2019re joined by Kevin Yoder from Kansas. (Applause.) Incredible guy. Kevin? Kevin Yoder. What an incredible guy. And members of Missouri\u2019s congressional delegation: Vicky Hartzler, Billy Long, Jason Smith, along with your state\u2019s Attorney General. Hopefully\u2014we need him so badly\u2014hopefully, your new senator-to-be, Josh Hawley. We need Josh badly. (Applause.) Josh, thank you. In fact, Josh, do me a favor. Come up here just for a second. Just shake my hand. This guy is a special man. Come here, Josh. Come here. (Applause.) HAWLEY: Well, it\u2019s an incredible honor to be here today. Thanks to all of you for your service and what you mean to this country. But how about the leadership of President Donald Trump? What do you think? (Applause.) You know, when I think about President Trump, there\u2019s one word that comes to mind. That word is \u201ccourage.\u201d Do you agree? (Applause.) How many people over the years have said that they\u2019ll do this, or they\u2019ll do that? But there\u2019s one guy who had the guts to actually fulfill his promises, the guts to move our embassy to Jerusalem, the guts to actually stand up against our enemies overseas, the guts to put conservatives on the Supreme Court of the United States\u2014and that\u2019s Donald Trump. (Applause.) You know, the President always says\u2014the President always says we\u2019re at a turning-point moment as a country; it\u2019s a critical time for our country. And he\u2019s providing the leadership that this country needs as we lead the world into this new century. And now I tell you what: I think he needs reinforcements in Washington, D.C. Do you agree with that? (Applause.) So let\u2019s do this\u2014let\u2019s show our appreciation again for President Trump and the leadership that he is giving to this country. And let\u2019s redouble our efforts and recommit ourselves to standing together, working hard, and making America great again. (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT: Wow. Goodbye, folks. (Laughter.) That was great. What a great young man. Before going any further, I want to take this moment to send our prayers to the victims of the tragic boat accident that took place in your great state last week. And I have to tell you, the whole world was watching that. We lost 17 beautiful souls, including 9 members of one family, and babies for whom life was just beginning. Their lives were cut short, but they and their loved ones will never, ever be forgotten. A tragedy. We will hold their memory close to our hearts. I want to thank your Governor, Mike Parson\u2014a friend of mine, a great person\u2014for his leadership during this terrible tragedy, along with the Coast Guard and all of the first responders who were incredible. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.) Next year will mark the 120th anniversary of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the oldest major veterans organization in our country. That\u2019s pretty good, right? (Applause.) For more than a century, the VFW has represented American heroes who promoted American values. And they did so with honor. You are the universal symbol of the patriotic pride that beats loudly in every single American heart. We don\u2019t apologize for America anymore. We stand up for America. (Applause.) We stand up for the patriots who defend America. (Applause.) And we stand up for our National Anthem. (Applause.) We\u2019re putting America first again, and we are seeing the incredible results. We\u2019re destroying the bloodthirsty killers known as ISIS\u2014almost gone. We\u2019re calling the threat by its real name, a name that wasn\u2019t mentioned for a long time. It\u2019s called radical Islamic terrorism. That\u2019s what it is. (Applause.) You have to know your enemy before you can defeat your enemy. Earlier this year, I recognized the true capital of Israel\u2014as Josh said\u2014Jerusalem, where we just opened the American Embassy. (Applause.) They thought it would never be named. And after it was named, they thought it would never get built. And I built it within four months. How about that one? You know that story. Four months. (Applause.) They came to my office; they had a document to be signed. One billion dollars for the embassy. I said, \u201c$1 billion?\u201d They didn\u2019t have a site; they didn\u2019t know anything. And our great Ambassador to Israel called\u2014David Friedman, who\u2019s a very successful lawyer in New York City; one of the most\u2014and he said, \u201cYou know, we can do it a lot faster. We have a great site. We have a building already on the site. We could renovate the building quickly, and we could open the embassy, if you\u2019d like to do that, sir.\u201d And I said, \u201cHow much would it cost?\u201d He said, \u201c$150,000.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat?\u201d What? (Applause.) He said, \u201cI think we can do it in four months.\u201d So we\u2019re talking about $1 billion, maybe in 20 years, maybe never. Probably never happens, right? We know what goes on. He starts out, \u201cI\u2019d rather build ships or I\u2019d rather build something else,\u201d if we can save the money. (Applause.) We can save that money; let\u2019s use it wisely. So I said, \u201cDavid, let\u2019s not do 150, let\u2019s do, like, how about $400,000? And make it nicer.\u201d And it\u2019s beautiful. It just opened, and it is beautiful. So, we\u2019re many years ahead of schedule. And I understand, frankly, every President, for the last many Presidents, have said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to open our embassy in Jerusalem.\u201d And then they never did it. They all failed. They never did it. And I understand why. Because when it came time, and when people were hearing rumors about it, I was inundated from calls of every leader from all over the world, imploring me, even demanding that we not do it, to a point where I never took their calls. I called them back after I did it. You know, it\u2019s one of those jobs\u2014(laughter)\u2014\u201clet me call them back.\u201d (Applause.) I was getting calls from kings and presidents and dictators. I was getting a call from everyone. And when I knew what it was about, I\u2019d say, \u201cTell them I\u2019ll call them next week.\u201d (Laughter.) Then I called them and I said, \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t know you felt that way. Well, it\u2019s too late.\u201d (Laughter.) But I understand why they didn\u2019t do it, because there was tremendous pressure. We did it. We\u2019re proud of it. It\u2019s there. Enjoy it. (Applause.) And, by the way, the biggest fan may very well be the evangelicals. They wanted that built. They wanted that there. So we\u2019re very\u2014we\u2019re very proud of it. (Applause.) We\u2019ve removed unnecessary restraints on our warfighters in Afghanistan. Those who risk their life and limb for our country, they deserve rules of engagement that give them the best opportunity to finally defeat the enemy. (Applause.) And we\u2019re making\u2014for the first time in years, we\u2019re making a lot of progress in Afghanistan. I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal. (Applause.) And Iran is not the same country anymore. That I can say. And we\u2019ll see what happens. But we\u2019re ready to make a real deal, not the deal that was done by the previous administration, which was a disaster. (Applause.) We\u2019re also pursuing the denuclearization of North Korea and a new future of prosperity, security, and peace on the Korean Peninsula and all of Asia. New images, just today, show that North Korea has begun the process of dismantling a key missile site. And we appreciate that. (Applause.) We had a fantastic meeting with Chairman Kim, and it seems to be going very well. I know we are joined today by many incredible veterans of the Korean War. Thank you for your courageous service. As you may know, we\u2019re also working to bring back the remains of your brothers-in-arms who gave their lives in Korea. And I hope that, very soon, these fallen warriors will begin coming home to lay at rest in American soil. That\u2019s starting the process. (Applause.) At the very end of our meeting, I said to Chairman Kim\u2014good relationship, good feeling\u2014I said, \u201cI would really appreciate if you could do that.\u201d He said, \u201cIt will be done.\u201d So I was very happy, and I think that process is starting fairly soon, we hope. (Applause.) Because we believe in no American left behind. We believe in that, right? No American left behind. (Applause.) I want to thank the VFW for your devotion to our fallen heroes, unknown soldiers, prisoners of war, and those missing in action, and their families. No one better understands the horrors of war than the people in this room. It is the warrior who bears the scars of battle and who prays most fervently for peace. That is why we remember George Washington\u2019s advice, that the best way to preserve the peace is to be prepared for war. (Applause.) And that is exactly what we do all the time. My thinking is always on military and military strength. That is why I\u2019m proud to report that we are now undertaking the greatest rebuilding of our United States military in its history. (Applause.) We have secured $700 billion for defense this year, and $716 billion next year approved. (Applause.) We\u2019re ordering 147 new F-35 Lightning fighters. This is an incredible plane. It\u2019s stealth; you can\u2019t see it. So when I talk to even people from the other side, they\u2019re trying to order our plane. (Laughter.) They like the fact that you can\u2019t see it. I said, \u201cHow would it do in battle with your plane?\u201d They say, \u201cWell, we have one problem: We can\u2019t see your plane.\u201d (Laughter.) That\u2019s a big problem. Stealth. Super Stealth. The best in the world. We make the best military equipment in the world. Also, remember this: jobs. (Applause.) We\u2019re ordering 239 Apache and Black Hawk helicopters. You know what they are. They\u2019re incredible. (Applause.) Nineteen major naval vessels, and nearly 8,000 Humvees. And these will be Humvees that are used by our great soldiers, not handed out to everybody like you\u2019ve been reading about in the past. (Applause.) All made right here in the USA. (Applause.) And we\u2019re adding nearly 30,000 new soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines. And I\u2019ve directed the Pentagon to begin the process of creating the sixth branch of our military. It\u2019s called the Space Force. (Applause.) We are living in a different world and we have to be able to adapt. And that\u2019s what it is. A lot of very important things are going to be taking place in space. And I just don\u2019t mean going up to the moon and going up to Mars, where we\u2019ll be going very soon. We\u2019ll be going to Mars very soon. But from a military standpoint, space is becoming every day more and more important. I\u2019m also thrilled to say that we have secured for our military servicemembers and their families the largest\u2014you don\u2019t really want it, you\u2019re too patriotic for this\u2014the largest pay raise in almost a decade. (Applause.) Largest pay raise. You don\u2019t want it. Nah. Anybody willing to give it up for the sake of your country? (Applause.) Okay, keep it. You deserve it. You really do. It\u2019s been a long time since you\u2019ve gotten a raise. You deserve it. My administration is committed to ensuring that our warfighters have the tools, the resources, the firepower that they need to defeat our enemies with overwhelming force. Hopefully we will never have to use the kind of power that I\u2019m building and helping to build for you. Hopefully people will look at us and they\u2019ll say, \u201cLet\u2019s pass. Let\u2019s pass.\u201d (Laughter and applause.) America is a peace-loving nation. We do not seek conflict. But if conflict is forced upon us, we will defend ourselves. And if we must, we will fight and we will do nothing but win. (Applause.) As the great General MacArthur once said, \u201cIn war there is no substitute for victory.\u201d Victory. We\u2019re also committed to ensuring that when our warriors return home as veterans, they receive the best care anywhere on Earth. (Applause.) Since taking office, and working alongside of the VFW\u2014and, by the way, your representatives have done an incredible job on helping us with the VA. A complicated subject. So many different things. They help us so much. Because we put in legislation\u2014I said, let\u2019s make sure it\u2019s legislation that\u2019s good and that works, not legislation that\u2019s obsolete before we even get it. If we\u2019re going to fight like hell to get everybody to approve it, let\u2019s get approved what\u2019s good. And we\u2019re enacted some of the largest VA reforms in the history of the VA. (Applause.) Probably the largest. Last year, I signed into the law landmark VA Accountability Act, which nobody thought we could get approved. Nobody. We\u2019re good at getting things approved. (Applause.) Nobody thought. Now, when a bad person\u2014maybe a federal employee, in this case\u2014but somebody bad mistreats or neglects or abuses our great veterans in their time of need, we can turn to them, look at them in the eye, and say, \u201cYou\u2019re fired. Get out! Get out!\u201d (Applause.) Before, there was nothing you could do. You had to live with these people. We\u2019ve gotten rid of a lot of people over the last year. Only the bad ones. The good ones we cherish. We cherish the good ones. But we had some bad apples, and they\u2019re gone. As promised, we established the White House VA Hotline, and every VA medical center now offers same-day emergency mental healthcare. Something very important. (Applause.) We\u2019re greatly expanding tele-health and walk-in clinics so our veterans can get anywhere at any time\u2014they can get what they need. They can learn about the problem. And they don\u2019t have to necessarily drive long distances and wait. We are also\u2014it\u2019s been a very big success. (Applause.) We\u2019re also processing veteran disability claims more quickly than ever before, by far. The VA has implemented the Decision Ready Claims process where claims can be completed in under two weeks. We\u2019re striving for one day\u2014but under two weeks. It used to be many, many months. (Applause.) Last year, I signed legislation\u2014it\u2019s amazing, I just said, \u201clast year.\u201d It\u2019s been a long time already, hasn\u2019t it? (Applause.) That was some campaign, wasn\u2019t it? (Applause.) I signed legislation so that veterans can use their GI Bill education benefits at any point in their lifetime. It\u2019s a big difference. (Applause.) They never expire, so vets can get the education they need when it is right for them. And with the VFW\u2019s tremendous help, we passed Veterans Choice\u2014the biggest thing ever. (Applause.) The biggest thing. That\u2019s got to be the biggest improvement you can have. So now, if you can\u2019t get treatment that you need in a timely manner\u2014people used to wait two weeks, three weeks, eight weeks\u2014they couldn\u2019t get to a doctor\u2014you will have the right to see a private doctor immediately and we will pay for it. And you know what? It\u2019s very, very cost effective. And thousands and thousands of lives are going to be saved. And your quality of life is going to be so much better. So you don\u2019t have to wait online for two and a half weeks to see a doctor, like in the past. Veterans Choice has been passed. (Applause.) And my administration also understands that we cannot be a safe country if we are not a prosperous country. We have to think of ourselves. You have to see these trade deals I\u2019m working on; they\u2019re a disaster. We\u2019re losing hundreds of billions of dollars with individual countries a year. And they\u2019re sticking\u2014you got to stick it out. You got to just\u2014we got to fight it. Nobody else fought it. I went to some of the countries, I said, \u201cHow did it get so imbalanced?\u201d They said, \u201cNobody ever called.\u201d (Laughter.) They said, \u201cNobody ever called.\u201d They\u2019d do whatever they wanted and we\u2019d just put up with it. Not any longer folks. Not any longer. (Applause.) We\u2019re making tremendous progress. They\u2019re all coming. They don\u2019t want to have those tariffs put on them. They\u2019re all coming to see us. And the farmers will be the biggest beneficiary. (Applause.) Watch. We\u2019re opening up markets. You watch what\u2019s going to happen. Just be a little patient. They\u2019re all aiming at anybody that likes me. And they have lobbyists like nobody has ever seen. They have the best lobbyists ever put together. I was hearing and reading that they have some of the greatest lobbying teams ever put together. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to stop the President from putting tariffs on these countries and these companies that are ripping off the United States. You\u2019ve got to stop him.\u201d Just remember, we\u2019re going to do something that, honestly, nobody else could do. Nobody else could do. We have a lot of \u2014 AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.) THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, darling. (Laughter.) I like you too. I like her. Thank you very much. That was good timing. (Laughter.) We\u2019re now in the midst of a great economic revival. And it\u2019s for that reason that I chose\u2014this is the time. Last year, our country lost 817 billion\u2014with a \u201cB\u201d\u2014dollars on trade. We lost $817 billion. And people say, \u201cOh, could you do it this week? Could you get it done immediately?\u201d These countries have been ripping us off for decades. It doesn\u2019t take a week. It takes a little longer. But we\u2019re going to get it done. But just remember, we can\u2019t lose $817 billion. We rebuilt China. What the European Union is doing to us is incredible. How bad. They made a $151 billion last year\u2014our trade deficit with the European Union. They sound nice but they\u2019re rough. They\u2019re all coming in to see me tomorrow. They\u2019re all coming to the White House. I said, \u201cYou have to change.\u201d They didn\u2019t want to change. I said, \u201cOkay. Good. We\u2019re going to tariff your cars.\u201d They send millions of cars\u2014Mercedes, all of them, BMW. So many cars. I said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to tariff your cars.\u201d They said, \u201cWhen can we show up? When can we be there?\u201d (Laughter.) \u201cWould tomorrow be okay?\u201d Oh, folks, stick with us. Stick with us. (Applause.) Amazing. But remember, they have the biggest, best, strongest lobbyists, and they\u2019re doing a number. Just stick with us. Don\u2019t believe the crap you see from these people\u2014the fake news. (Applause.) I mean, I saw a piece on NBC today. NBC\u2014not just CNN. CNN is the worst. (Laughter.) But I saw a piece on NBC; it was heart-throbbing. They were interviewing people\u2014they probably go through 20, and then they pick the one that sounds like the worst. But they went through a group of people. In fact, I wanted to say, \u201cI got to do something about this Trump.\u201d (Laughter.) Terrible. And that piece was done by the lobbyists and by the people that they hire. It was a total setup. This country is doing better than it\u2019s ever done before, economically. This is the time to take off the rip-off of tariff. We have to do it. (Applause.) You know, other countries have tariffs on us. So when I say, \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to put tariffs on them, they all start screaming, \u2018He\u2019s using tariffs.'\u201d China charges us, when we make a car, a 25 percent tariff. We charge them 2.5 percent. Other than that, it\u2019s a fair deal. Okay? (Laughter.) Similar things with other countries, like the European Union. They\u2019re a big abuser. But it\u2019s all working out. And just remember: What you\u2019re seeing and what you\u2019re reading is not what\u2019s happening. And I\u2019ll tell you, I have so many people that are so in favor\u2014because we have to make our country truly great again. Remember? \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d And then, in two and a half years, it\u2019s called, \u201cKeep America Great.\u201d So the way we keep America great is to make at least reasonable\u2014I\u2019m not saying\u2014at least reasonable, at least fair trade deals. Not stupid trade deals, like we\u2019ve put up with for 25 years. So we\u2019re changing it, and we\u2019re changing it rapidly. (Applause.) Over the last little more than a year and a half, we\u2019ve created 3.7 million jobs since election. African American, Hispanic, and Asian American unemployment has reached the lowest levels ever recorded in our country\u2019s history\u2014the lowest levels. Unemployment\u2014lowest level. (Applause.) Remember, I used to say\u2014I said it here: \u201cWhat do you have to lose?\u201d I was right. Women\u2019s unemployment recently achieved a 65-year low. Lowest in 65 years. (Applause.) You\u2019ll like this one. Veterans\u2019 unemployment has fallen to the lowest level in almost 18 years. We\u2019re working to make it better. I\u2019m sorry. You know, \u201c18 years\u201d isn\u2019t so good when you hear \u201chistory\u201d and \u201c65 years.\u201d (Applause.) Eighteen years. And I\u2019ll guarantee, within a month or two months, that 18 will be even a much higher number. We take great care of our vets. Consumer, business, and manufacturing confidence has reached its all-time highs. Confidence is all-time high. We\u2019ve cut a record number of job-killing regulations. No President, no matter how long they\u2019ve been in office\u2014even though we\u2019re only here for a short time\u2014has cut anywhere near the regulations. And these are unnecessary. These are waste regulations. It would take 20 years to get approval to build a highway. We\u2019re trying to bring it down to one year. We have it down to about two. We\u2019re trying to get it down to one. And if it doesn\u2019t work, or if it\u2019s environmentally unsound, or there\u2019s something wrong, we\u2019re not going approve it. But we\u2019re not going to take a process 20, 21 years, and then raise your hand that it\u2019s not approved. We\u2019ll let you know in a period of a year or maybe two. Right now, it\u2019s at two; we\u2019re trying to bring it down to one. We passed the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history. Biggest in history. (Applause.) And unfortunately, we had tremendous opposition for lowering your taxes from Claire McCaskill. She voted against. Unbelievable. AUDIENCE: Booo \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Unbelievable. And she wants to now end it so that you pay more. You figure this one out. I don\u2019t know\u2014is that good? You figure that one out. In the first quarter of this year alone, American companies repatriated a record of nearly $300 billion\u2014this is in the first quarter. And it\u2019s coming back into our country, with our companies, and our employment, and building plants, and factories, and headquarters in our country, where it belongs. (Applause.) We think the number\u2014and this is all because of our tax reform and tax cuts\u2014we think the number will be close to $4 trillion, coming back into our country\u2014money that would never have been seen by you, or us, or me. (Applause.) And just like I promised, we are confronting the unfair trade deals, and we are doing it like nobody has ever done, because our workers have been cheated, our companies have been cheated. They\u2019ve stolen our wealth. They\u2019ve brought it to other countries. As you know, I campaigned on that issue; it\u2019s very close to my heart. I understand that issue better than anybody. I don\u2019t like it when they close a factory in your state, or a plant in your great state, and they move it to another country, and they make the product. They fire all of you, and they make the product, and they send it back into our country to be sold tax-free. I don\u2019t like that. I don\u2019t like that. (Applause.) We\u2019re stopping it. We\u2019re stopping it. Because companies are moving back into our country like never before. You saw Chrysler announce, many are announcing. Japan has just announced two big companies are opening up...\r\nin Michigan. We have a lot of companies coming back into our country. You haven\u2019t seen that for 25 years. You haven\u2019t seen it. (Applause.) And we need workers. Because our unemployment rate at 3.8 percent is so low\u2014now we\u2019re taking people off the rolls, and we\u2019re training people, but we need workers. And that\u2019s why I want people coming in. You know, people don\u2019t say this, and they certainly don\u2019t report it, but I want people coming into our country, but I want them coming in based on merit. I want the merit system, so they can help us. (Applause.) Merit. The forgotten men and women of our country are forgotten no more. The Democrats are trying to find out, \u201cWho are these people that came out to vote? Where did they come from?\u201d Remember that? \u201cWhere did they come from?\u201d Now they know, but they\u2019re not going to the Democrats who are going so far left that nobody can believe it. They want open borders, and crime is okay. We want strong borders and we want no crime. Other than that, we\u2019re very similar. (Applause.) Other than that, we\u2019re very similar. We also know that to be a strong nation, we have to have these strong borders. We cannot send our military to confront threats abroad, only to allow those same threats to cross our borders and to threaten us right here at home. (Applause.) We help other countries protect their borders, and we don\u2019t protect our own borders. How about that? We\u2019re fighting every day to secure our borders, and we\u2019re doing a great job. But we\u2019re not given the tools. We have the worst laws in any country, ever, in history. We have catch-and release. You catch them, and now we say, \u201cGive me your name. Oh, good\u2014come back in a couple of years. We\u2019ll take you to court. You\u2019re released.\u201d This is\u2014these are\u2014this is the policy of fools. Catch-and-release. You catch even a criminal, you catch a bad person, you release the person as soon as you catch them. We have to end it. Despite that, we\u2019re doing a great job. And ICE\u2014ICE. Oh, ICE. Thank goodness for ICE. (Applause.) Because we have some of the worst drug dealers, terrorists, criminals, and MS-13 gang members\u2014and we\u2019re either throwing them the hell in jail, or throwing them out of our country. And ICE goes up there, and they walk in like it\u2019s another day in the office. Thank goodness for ICE. (Applause.) The Democrats want to abandon ICE. They want to end ICE. They\u2019re too strong. I saw one of the people get\u2014they\u2019re too strong. They\u2019re too strong. I think MS-13 is strong, too. (Laughter.) The only thing they understand is strength. They don\u2019t understand anything but strength. And ICE is tough and smart, and they track them down, and they stop tremendous amounts of crime. And these are great people, and they\u2019re not being treated properly. (Applause.) And the fact is, instead of supporting our ICE officers, many of these Democrat politicians who are, really, disciples of a very low IQ person, Maxine Waters \u2014 AUDIENCE: Booo \u2014 THE PRESIDENT:\u2014and perhaps even worse, Nancy Pelosi \u2014 AUDIENCE: Booo \u2014 THE PRESIDENT:\u2014they\u2019ve launched vicious smears on the brave men and women who defend our communities. ICE officers work in dangerous conditions to protect our communities. And more than a third of ICE officers happen to be veterans themselves. About a third. (Applause.) But Democratic politicians want to abolish ICE. They want to see open borders. Can you imagine? You know, every once in a while you\u2019ll hear something, and usually you understand. Like in deal-making, you always have to understand the other side. When you hear \u201copen borders,\u201d when you hear \u201cget rid of ICE,\u201d when you hear some of the things that they\u2019re proposing, it\u2019s like you can\u2019t even understand it. Can you imagine, open borders, you\u2019d have millions of people pouring into our country. Millions and millions of people. Many people that you don\u2019t want in our country. But you would have millions of people pouring into our country. The crime would be unbelievable. And they want to get rid of the crime fighter, on top of everything else. \u201cOpen the border and get rid of your crime fighters.\u201d You don\u2019t understand it. Nobody understands it. But I hope they keep it up, because we\u2019re going to have a lot of fun in four months, and we\u2019re going to have a lot of fun in 2020 running against that. (Applause.) My administration will always stand proudly with the heroes of ICE and Border Patrol. They\u2019re all heroes. And I want them to know that we thank them. (Applause.) The Veterans of Foreign Wars understand better than anyone the importance of honoring those who put service to their fellow citizens before they put service to themselves. That\u2019s both at home and abroad. (Applause.) Here with us today is an extraordinary man who embodies the highest ideals of loyalty, patriotism, and service. He is a World War II veteran from the great state of Pennsylvania. That\u2019s another one we won. (Applause.) We won you guys by 20 points. Of course, I\u2019m not going to bring that up. (Laughter.) I\u2019m not going to tell that to George Brett. Twenty points. Many of you know him well; he\u2019s a lifelong member of the VFW\u2014Sergeant Allen Jones. Where\u2019s Allen? Where\u2019s Allen? (Applause.) Sergeant. Should we bring him up? AUDIENCE: Yeah! (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT: Come on, Allen. Come on. (Applause.) He\u2019s only 94, and the Secret Service made him walk about 100 yards out of his way, but that\u2019s okay. (Laughter.) That\u2019s okay. (Applause.) JONES: I just\u2014thank you. This is one of the highlights of this 94-year-old man. I just want to tell you a few things. May I? THE PRESIDENT: Yes. JONES: Mr. President \u2014 (Laughter.) THE PRESIDENT: I\u2019ve got time. JONES: I had four brothers serve in World War II. My oldest brother was lost off the coast of Italy. Many times, I just wish that he could come back to the Land of the Free and the Home of Brave again. (Applause.) I\u2019ve given to the Veterans of Foreign Wars 70 years of my life. (Applause.) Thank you. My wife is with me today, but she\u2019s not here. She\u2019s not feeling well. And my children are watching me today, hopefully\u2014(laughter)\u2014to know that their dad got to stand beside the President of the United States\u2014(applause)\u2014with the President. Mr. President, I want to ask you something. (Laughter.) I\u2019ve been told that I could never enter the Oval Office in Washington, D.C. I\u2019m going to be 95 years of age April 11th of next year. Hopefully, that you will allow me to bring my family into the Oval Office \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Yes. JONES:\u2014to meet you. (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT: Anytime you want. Anytime. JONES: One last thing, Mr. President. (Laughter.) I want to tell you, Mr. President, this group knows not to give the mic to Allen Q. Jones when he\u2019s at a state convention or the national convention. (Laughter.) I asked you to autograph this picture personally, because this was taken to you\u2014with you when you were running for election \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: That\u2019s right. JONES:\u2014as a President of the United States. THE PRESIDENT: Oh, it\u2019s beautiful. Thank you. Beautiful. Wow. Let me have\u2014(laughter and applause). I have a good one here, Allen. That\u2019s so beautiful. (Applause.) Going to stay up here. Okay, I got to do this. You got it. Thank you, Allen. Thank you. JONES: God bless you, Mr. President. and I wish you well in the future. (Applause.) Thank you. THE PRESIDENT: I started to get a little bit concerned when he was finishing. (Laughter.) Well, this is a President that will have you in the Oval Office. So all of my people back there, they\u2019re working it out already. Okay? (Applause.) With honor. And we pay tribute not only to Allen, but to all of the heroes of the Greatest Generation. (Applause.) And I\u2019d like to take this moment to recognize every World War II veteran in the audience today. Each of you is a national treasure. It\u2019s true. (Applause.) We will never forget what you did for us\u2014ever. From Bunker Hill to Belleau Wood, from Iwo Jima to the Inchon Landing, Americans have stormed into danger, stared down evil, and stood strong and tall for God, country, and freedom. (Applause.) Anytime we see an American in uniform from the Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, or Coast Guard, our hearts swell with pride. And anywhere those uniforms appear, our enemies tremble with fear because they know there is no greater force for peace and justice than the United States military. (Applause.) To every single member of the VFW, because of your service, your courage, and your example, we are restoring the dreams and the glory, and the greatness of America. We will never give in. We will never give up. And we will never stop fighting for our country, our flag, and our freedom. (Applause.) Together we will keep on fighting and we will keep on winning as one people, one family, and one nation under God. Thank you. God bless you. (Applause.) God bless our veterans. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.) Thank you very much.", "Date": "July 24, 2018"}
